Always a bit bummed returning to the mainland after enjoying a vacation in Hawaii but enjoying first class with a lie flat seat makes the return a little easier. 

Checking the details out a few days later I noticed that the aircraft had apparently been changed to a narrow body jet, meaning no lie flat seats!

Fortunately I was able to reroute our travel through HNL and book the desired lie flat seats.  Accomplished via the HA website with online texting. 

Thankfully I noticed all this just a week after booking the trip. We don’t travel until June. If we couldn’t take advantage of our desired seats we would have been somewhat disappointed.

Update 
Supervisor was able to help me I just had to rebuy the ticket to prove I was really going to use it for someone else. After writing this post I have learned that airlines do not offer name transfer and to always buy refundable tickets. I am very grateful for the supervisor for helping me because I know she didn’t have to help me. Thank you to everyone commenting and explaining the rules of transferring names, refundable tickets and insurance. 




If you plan on flying with Hawaiian make sure you get insurance. My dad bought us tickets to Hawaii for next week as a gift I had plans on taking my 3yr old daughter she is level 3 autistic. At the time of on the book in January her behavior and meltdowns weren’t as bad recently things have been getting worse. We decided it would be better that she stayed with her dad and other grandparents. So we called Hawaiian to ask to cancel her ticket and transfer it to someone else so my dad didn’t lose out on his money. The agent yelled at me and told me it’s against their policy and there nothing they could do. I explained everything I was calm and asked to speak to a supervisor he continued to yell and say there was no supervisors and the answer was no. He said the only thing he can offer me was a credit that only my 3 yr old daughter could use within a yr again that wouldn’t work because she can’t fly and obviously can’t fly alone. I kept demanding to speak to a supervisor he finally agrees I guess one magically appeared. The supervisor was so nice and so understanding of the situation and understood that it wouldn’t be safe to fly with a child that can’t regulate her moods. She offered me to rebuy the ticket and she would refund my daughter ticket as long as I was really transferring it to someone else which I was and everything got solved. I wish the first agent just listened to what was going on and had empathy. I wasn’t looking for a refund at all. 

For future reference always get insurance and read the small print just in case you never know. ",Ginny_Mama,95,90,HawaiianAirlines

I doubled checked yesterday and looks like they have swapped planes and our seats have been changed. Two of my kids no longer have assigned seats and all seats near us appear to be full.

1cegubz,2024-04-27 23:15:14,"Well, that was fun","Yesterday morning, after much looking, I went to book our trip from AUS-HNL. From my previous searches, I knew they only flew this route on Mondays and Thursdays, and only returned on Wednesdays and Sundays; all other days in the search calendar are disabled. However, when I finally went to book, this had inverted, and now Sundays and Wednesdays were the only days enabled for the outbound, and vice versa for the return. That would be fine, but when you search on those enabled days, there are no flight results. I manually typed in the date for Monday and forced the search, and voila, there was the flight. I booked it, and called HA to upgrade with miles.

About 6 hours later, I logged into ""My Trips"" just to gawk at my reservation, I guess, and I noticed it was missing. No matter, let me look it up by the confirmation code. No such reservation. I texted HA and was informed that somehow, the previous agent neglected to ticket my upgrade, so the system auto-canceled the whole reservation, and now the flight was ""sold out."" Uh... it was only half full a few hours ago? Did all of the 49ers book the remaining seats? Worse yet, they couldn't find the 150,000 miles I had used for the upgrade. I was asked to call in and request a supervisor.

While I awaited a supervisor, I had a hunch, and went back on HA's booking search. This time, when I used the new enabled days, there was a flight result (at a different time, too). It became apparent that they must have been rolling out a schedule change yesterday, and somehow the web team made their change before the actual schedule/backend change was complete. I got my supervisor, who was equally as perplexed as the text agent, saying that the flight had been canceled. At this point, I revealed my hypothesis, she did some checking, and said I was right.

Supervisor was ultimately able to locate my money and my points, void the old reservation out, redeposit everything to my account, and stayed with me while I rebooked the new dates, then executed my miles upgrade. The bittersweet upside to this is that the new flights had cheaper, Saver upgrades available, so I ended up with miles leftover (I had transferred in exactly what I needed from AmEx). I was able to salvage these by getting a convertible for our 3 days on the Big Island.

Not exactly how I wanted to spend my Friday night, but seems to be fixed now - unless they make another change in the next few months (I hear the AUS-HNL route is volatile), and as frustrating as the issue was, all of the agents were unexpectedly kind, understanding, and helpful - a lost skill in today's customer service. The IT consultant in me wanted to ask for the CIO's number because it looks like this was all caused by a wildly uncoordinated change - even if I was *kinda* breaking stuff to make my reservation (but hey, my forcible search showed a flight that, at that time, existed).

Anyway, if I still have any of you after all of that, do I get a free checked bag if I upgraded with miles? My ticket says 0PC, so I don't know if the miles upgrade only gets me Fisher Price First Class and I still gotta pay for my bags.",Matchboxx,10,22,HawaiianAirlines

Everyone knows you need to get to the airport early. There are reasons why you can. A traffic accident , medical emergency, lost passport, on and on. I got to the Honolulu airport 2.35 hours before my flight to return a defective car to rental company. The car had a dangerous issue: the engine randomly accelerated when stopped- it literally pulled my family through a red light on McCully. I did not expect to spend 45 minutes dealing with this. 

When I got off the phone with customer support, I rushed downstairs to terminal 2, where an airport employee was directly all Hawaiian Air passengers to terminal 1. I told him I was going to Japan on HA821. He said that I needed to check in at terminal 1. I didn’t believe that. Didn’t make sense. At terminal 2 I asked the agricultural inspectors where the check in counter for HA was. They said there wasn’t any. I should check for code share. I couldn’t find a code share and couldn’t see my flight on the board.  In any case, the board does indicate where checking is located. So I walked, hoping to see a HA sign somewhere. Finally, I went to the JAL counter to ask and was told to go to the end of the terminal. I got to the HA check in at 11:30  and stood in line thinking all others were on the same flight. I got to the counter at 11:58 and was told the flight closed 8 minutes ago. 
No announcements from staff that the gate was going to close. No request for passengers on that flight to come forward. Only, the gate is closed. Next time come earlier. Please call your travel agent

I felt the food service was good on HNL-NRT. On both flights there was maybe 1 or 2 flight attendants that weren't able to speak Japanese, I was surprised at how many of the crew were bilingual (Even the American accented Captain gave an announcement in Japanese about 40 minutes before landing in Narita)! The breakfast service on KIX-HNL was great as well.

My only complaint was when we left Kansai Airport. When we boarded in Honolulu we boarded by Zones. In Kansai (despite having Zones on our boarding passes) it was ""ADA Guests first, Business/First Class"", then they got to ""Main Cabin may board"" and it was basically a free for all. Thankfully there was overhead bin space above our seat, but that was a little irritating. I would have liked for them to say ""Ignore the zones, board when we say 'Main Cabin'."" My assumption was due to the fact there weren't Hawaiian employees checking us in or checking the boarding passes (IIRC they were Japan Airlines employees). Otherwise, an enjoyable experience on Hawaiian's long haul product.",nascarfan88421032,0,7,HawaiianAirlines

I just checked their terms and they’re pretty shitty.

On 09/24/23, I was speaking with a supervisor (Marcus) on their customer service line. Long story short, he was unable to fix a booking issue I was having so he cancelled the whole booking, saying I would receive my refund of $3000 within 7-10 business days (The 10th business day being 10/06/23). I have a confirmation email for this refund. 

 

On 10/10/23, still no refund. I call their customer service line and spoke to an agent (Hope) who said she looked into the matter, sent an email to their accouting dept to prioritize this refund, and she promised me that I would receive it the following Monday at the latest (Which would be 10/16/23).

 

On 10/16/23, you guessed it, still no refund. Called them back and this time asked to speak with a supervisor and spoke with one named Joe. After going back and forth, me ranting about my displeasure, he absolutely guaranteed that the refund will come by 10/25/23, even going as far as saying he would compensate me further if it doesn’t come.

 

On 10/25/23, you guessed it again…. Still no refund. Called back and specifically requested Joe to call me back, which he did. He went through the rolodex of excuses, the same ones Ive already heard the three previous phone calls. I ask to speak with his supervisor or a supervisor from accounting, he said there was no one above him and I cant speak with accounting. We go back and forth and he basically said it should come by 10/31/23 (Notice he stopped guaranteeing dates now). He even said he will personally check in everyday and give me a courtesy call everyday to let me know of updates on the refund. I agreed to wait one last time for the end of the month.

 

Well today is 10/31/23, not a single courtesy call from Joe since and still no refund. I plan on calling them tomorrow but I expect it to go the same as the previous 4 phone calls…

 

What recourse do I have here? Ive been extremely patient and reasonably accommodating for their myriad of excuses but at one point you have to draw a line in the sand, and we’ve crossed that line.

1ayokc3,2024-02-24 15:18:44,Bullied by flight attendants. Help,"
I had a family emergency and had to travel from Honolulu to Tokyo with my mother who needed wheel chair service and my 2yo. I did not expect any extra help with my situation, but certainly didn't foresee being targeted by bullies when I'm in a stressful position. 

Unfortunately, I did not get their names because I've never had anything like this happen to me before - lesson learned. Will write to the airline next. Want to get some third person perspectives here.

First, a flight attendant ran out at me out at me from the back of the flight when I was grabbing something from the overhead compartment calling me out for being distracting. I asked her if there is something I did that I wasn't supposed to - she couldn't tell me anything specific and stormed off. 

I felt very confused and honestly a little shaken because I still had to take care of my mother and son who sits in different rows, I will need to get up and down a lot, while it feels like someone is watching and judging my every move.

I don't believe I violated any safety guidelines, so I asked for the head flight attendant to clarify if there is a problem. She started by saying you probably just did A or B, both were not true and making it even more confusing. I tried to communicate further in a calm manner. I could tell she was also in a mood and determined to make me stop talking. Some things that were said baffled me  -

- a rhetorical why do you need to take anything from the overhead compartment?

- she didn't call you a name or anything, don't take it personally 

- there are people paying high premium here to be comfortable, you need to stop

- why do you keep arguing? if you keep going, we are going to have a problem

She was very defensive and not helpful. I felt gas lighted and that I was being talked to instead of getting a simple clarification. 

It's been about a month since that flight, I tried to let my emotions run its course and still feel pretty strongly that their behavior is unprofessional to say the least",woodia,12,2,HawaiianAirlines

When I called to do the upgrade, they put it through and then told me we're not seated together and said ""only the gate agents can change our seats, so plan to arrive early."" We opted to not take the risk and just went back to our two seats together in coach. 

I've never had this experience before and my uninformed assumption is that given there are so few 1st class seats, anyone who got a seat they wanted to is not going to give it up. Meaning, they had every intention to sit in the 2nd row, next to the window, vs 1st row in the aisle, etc. Even if it was a switch from different rows but same seat letter, I'm doubtful they would agree since each row is a little different.

**TL/DR** - How much power does the gate agent have to switch other 1st class passenger seats? Would it be no problem at all to seat a couple together? Or would they have to get permission from the other passenger we'd like to swap a seat with?",shmallkined,26,0,HawaiianAirlines

16vwwl0,2023-09-30 11:59:21,Has Anyone Flown with a Guitar?,"Hi everyone,

I am going to book a Hawaiian Airlines flight from Honolulu to California for next month but I have an acoustic guitar that I’d like to take with me. The agent I spoke to said that I have three choices: A) Put it in the overhead bin (if it fits) or B) Purchase another seat for it or C) Check it in as baggage. 

Best case scenario is putting it in the overhead bin but I nor the agent could find out what the size of the overhead bin is to see if it would fit. The size of the hard case of my guitar would be 44.5” length and 18” width. If it doesn’t fit in the overhead bin, I’d have to then check it in. I don’t want to do that in case my guitar gets damaged. Are the flight attendants good about storing it in the back in a closet for people? Does anyone have a recent experience with flying with an acoustic guitar?

UPDATE: I got a softer case for it and was able to get on the plane without checking it in. When I got on, I asked a flight attendant if they could put it in the back of the plane for me because it absolutely was not fitting in the overhead bin, and they kindly took it and did just that for me. Overall, it was a smooth process and no damage to the guitar!",[deleted],2,3,HawaiianAirlines

1g2md8h,2024-10-13 18:04:23,"Our Surreal Incident with Hawaiian Airlines (Oct 11th, SAN-HNL)","Hi everyone, I'm writing this because I just felt like it'd be cathartic to write about my family and my experiences these past couple of days.

On Oct. 11th, 2024, my family and I (2 adults and 1 almost toddler), took off from San Diego, on Hawaiian Airlines, headed for Oahu. We had planned on being in Hawaii for about 3 days on a short vacation during this holiday weekend.

About an hour and half into our flight, the flight crew announced to us the unfortunate news that our plane would have to return to San Diego due to mechanical issues they were not able to resolve. They assured us that the issue was not detrimental to the integrity of the plane, but did not elaborate any further.

My wife and I were frustrated, but we figured it was for the best, because we didn't want to be flying on a plane that had unresolved mechanical issues. We figured they'd land and, possibly, transfer us into a different flight or fix the mechanical issue. At the very least, we'd be back in San Diego and probably have to go home.

About 45 minutes into the flight back, the flight crew announced that we were rerouted to Oakland International airport instead by some managing staff. That's when my wife and I started to get worried. We were hopeful that the airline would figure things out, but it looked less and less likely that we'd make it to Hawaii that same day. Plus, we'd now be stuck in Oakland with our baby and not knowing what the airline planned.

Our fears were confirmed about 40 minutes after we had landed and all the passengers had been kept on the airplane (but allowed to stand and stretch): the crew had to be relieved due to reaching the limits of their work time and there was no other flights and crews available to fly us out from Oakland. The manager on duty figured that the soonest we could get on another flight out would be the next day at 8 am. There would be accommodations provided, but everyone would have to line up to get them (while the airplanes luggage was being unloaded).

To make matters worse, we heard from several of the Hawaiian Airlines staff (including an announcement from the manager) that the mechanical failure was due to a heating element malfunctioning in the cargo area of the plane and that an animal in that area had to be checked on. Ultimately, we found out that animal was a dog. The whole flight of 400+ people was diverted and cancelled because of one (1) pet dog.

Based on the information we had at the time on the plane, my wife and I decided to cancel our trip and try to recoup our money. That process included: contacting Costco Travel and cancelling our travel package, calling Hawaiian Airlines to get a refund, and figuring how we'd get home from Oakland.

Costco Travel was, surprisingly, the easiest part of the process to cancel our trip. We explained our situation and they offered to refund us, understandably, with a loss of $300 for one day of accomodations. We were advised to contact our credit card to see if travel insurance could cover the remaining losses.

As we waited in line to get a hotel room, my wife called the Hawaiian Airlines customer service to request for a refund. The customer service staff initially offered a ""refund"" but wasn't willing to clearly state for how much, instead telling my wife she'd be notified after a decision was made by phone or email.

After the roundabout explanation and lack of assurances, the staff person asked if my wife accepted the terms. This upset my wife and she refused to accept their offer. Pressing for clarity, the staff person finally relented and explained that only half of our ticket costs would be refunded because we had already utilized half the cost of the round-trip tickets by flying with Hawaiian Airlines.

The terms offered were unacceptable to my wife, and she asked for a manager. (I am very appreciative of her calm under stressful circumstances, because I would have been intolerable.) Eventually, she spoke to the manager, explained our situation about being stranded in a random city with a baby, and the manager agreed to a full refund.

As for getting home, the Hawaiian Airlines customer service manager said they could not provide for us flights home, due to something related to the Alaska Airlines merger. They suggested we ask the ticketing desk manager for a voucher for car rental expenses, which we learned later that they couldn't provide. On top of that, Hawaiian Airlines announced that they scrambled a flight out at 1am the next day, well after we'd cancelled our travel package and while in the middle of the call with customer service.

About a day and a half later, a Thrifty rental car parked in our driveway, and out $500+, we're home safely, thank goodness. But there's still things that need to resolve, calls to be made, and receipts to submit; I just can't get over just how much hassle and frustration and uncertainty we had to go through.

Tldr: Flight from SAN-HNL was diverted and cancelled due to mechanical failure to a random airport, therefore Hawaii trip cancelled, but Hawaiian Airlines resisted refunding full costs and did not provide a way home.",empty83,9,0,HawaiianAirlines

1ditzbs,2024-06-18 23:51:18,Connecting flights headache—is it worth still flying through HA?,"We have booked our flights going from LAX to KOA. This is a direct flight through Hawaiian using sign on points we got a while back.

Unfortunately HA doesn’t have any direct/reasonable flights from Chicago, hence why we did LAX. The current issue I’m running into is the Chicago to LAX tickets.

Essentially the round trip connecting flight for Chicago / LAX costs nearly the same as a round trip ORD / LAS / KOA through Southwest.

If we keep the Hawaiian flights, our biggest issue is having a 5+ hour layover coming home when we land in LAX. I’m also worried if there’s any flight delays or cancellations since these flights are being coordinated separately. And again, while our HA flights were basically free, we are paying almost the same amount for the connecting flight as we would for Chicago -&gt; KOA through another airline.

We purchased basic cabin with HA so we wouldn’t get a refund but I think we can change the flights. However I’m not sure what we would change it to.

I’m just at a loss for what is worth doing. Keep the HA flights and coordinate the connecting flights separately—even if cost/timing isn’t ideal? Or cancel HA entirely and book the flights through Southwest?

Any insight is greatly appreciated 🙏",MagentaDevil,10,5,HawaiianAirlines

Allianz reimbursed everything within two weeks with  proof of all the above, along with a document from HA proving the flight was indeed cancelled.

When I asked about the new arrival and the likelihood that there wouldn't be flights in the middle of the night in Maui to take me on to Kona, she rudely said - DID YOU NOT HEAR THE ANNOUNCEMENT WE JUST MADE? You didn't hear it?

Surprised, I said yes, I heard about the delay, my concern is that aren't flights when we land. 

She said they can't control the flights and the connecting flights will be determined when we're in the air. She seemed incredibly frustrated (understandably, lots of people were upset and lots of chaos was happening) and even when I asked again, how will I get a new flight from Maui to Kona if there are no flights in the middle of the night. I don't want to be stranded in Maui overnight. 

She got visibly annoyed and said, YOU ARE NOT LISTENTING TO ME. We can't control when the flights are going to be scheduled until we're in the air. I said, I understand but then we will still have to be traveling for hours on end. I wanted to get a flight for the next day and get answers to what that would entail. My baseline expectation would have been for her try understand what my question/concern was and help solve it. Instead, she said, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT THIS EFFECTS. There are other people here trying to get to Kona. I said I understand that and must have looked shocked, and I was, at how she was speaking to me. Then, she looked at Tim and interrupted him while he was still helping the woman in front of me to say, Can you deal with her? She's not getting it. She's just not getting it. And walked away. 

To his immense credit, throughout the entire morning and situation, Tim was incredibly calm and collected. When he asked me how he could help, I told him I'd like to book the flight for the next day as I live locally and don't want to travel that many hours and miss another connecting flight. While helping me, he was interrupted several times by other agents who needed his help or input and with his phone ringing. I told him I would wait until he was able to take care of those things. As he was helping me, I heard the same gate agent talk to the person behind me - who had the same situation of going to Kona and having kids and not being ideal to have them all travel for that long and that late. She was incredibly empathetic, understanding, asked where he and his family were sitting, went to them and walked them to a different kiosk to help with booking another flight. Same situation, completely different response. At this point, I started crying. And I cried through the whole interaction with Tim. No one acknowledged that or asked or offered any kind of empathy. The gate agent made me feel less than human, like an idiot. I have deep empathy in these high stress situations, having worked in Customer Service for 15 years. This was not ok and it wasn't warranted.

While Tim was able to move me to tomorrow's flight, he didn't ask about seat assignments, or give any other information or set expectations - except, my bag will be on tomorrow's flight. I think. I took a taxi home and will take another taxi back tomorrow. Another expense I didn't expect to incur. Then, when I got home, I called customer service to see if I could change my seat assignment as the one he assigned wasn't in the same class. I was on hold for over 30 minutes and total call time was an hour. At first, the agent said she could refund the seat upgrade I had on the original flight and then I'd just have to pay for the upgrade for the new flight. I selected a seat and then she said could no longer assign me any seats other than the one Tim assigned because seating had been locked down by the gate agents. I will have to go tomorrow to see if there is a way I can get my preferred seat. At least she was able to get me a refund for my original seat upgrade which is something that Tim never offered. So, I'll get on my flight tomorrow and hope it doesn't break down or get treated like less than and that my luggage will actually make it there. 

What makes me extra upset is that I had booked this trip on Alaska Airlines originally and changed it last minute because I wanted to treat myself to what has always been exceptional experiences with Hawaiian.

Finally, the fact that the flight wasn’t cancelled, likely because doing so would incur significant reimbursement costs, was a business decision that put the onus of the maintenance mistake onto many passengers. This trip will end up costing me more than $1000 more than anticipated because Hawaiian didn’t want to do the right thing by their customers. Those costs are missed accommodations, transportation, and food.

There were so many moments for this business to do the right thing, to solidify and strengthen customer loyalty, that just weren’t met. I get it – things are hard all over, gas/oil prices, competition, inflation, etc. But this ain't how you fix it. Please start with ensuring gate agents, Ops folks, and crew are paid fairly and aren't overworked, and please provide empathy training.

I also bit the bullet and bought the extra comfort on HA website which was like $550 extra.

Now I just realized (after 1 month of booking ) that I should have bought the connecting flight from HNL-&gt;OGG...

On Amex Travel I only see an option to cancel the trip which I'm too scared to do. I'm scared to lose 100k worth of points and extra $550 i paid for extra comfort. I know it's silly...

So my only choice seems to be booking a separate round trip for HNL-&gt;OGG... not only I'm losing money because of my stupid mistake (it's way cheaper to buy all connecting flight together), I also need to claim my luggage at HNL and re-check-in them again for HNL-&gt;OGG.

1deyb7p,2024-06-13 20:55:30,Questions about Using Hawaiian Airlines Miles and Credit Card for Upcoming Trip to Oahu,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning a trip to Oahu from January 8th to January 22nd, 2025, and I have a few questions about using Hawaiian Airlines and maximizing my miles. I've plan to book a package trip that includes flights and a hotel for two weeks, and it costs $8,000 for two people.

Currently, I don't have any Hawaiian Miles cards, but I do have a JetBlue card with 38,000 miles.

1. **Can I transfer my JetBlue miles to Hawaiian Miles?** If so, how many Hawaiian Miles would I get for my 38,000 JetBlue miles?
2. **Should I get the Hawaiian Miles card?** There's an offer that gives 70,000 points after spending $2,000 in the first 90 days. If I put the trip on the card, will that count toward the $2,000 spend requirement?
3. **Points Calculation:** Assuming I get the card and everything goes well, I would have around 108,000 points (70,000 from the card + 38,000 from JetBlue if transferable). How much would this reduce the cost of my trip?
4. **Tips for Making the Trip Cheaper:** Are there any other ways to make this trip more affordable? Any advice or offers or strategies that I might have overlooked?

I plan to pay off the $8,000 package by putting it on the Hawaiian Miles card. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help!",SGangemella13,8,0,HawaiianAirlines

Hi everyone. I need to know if there is anyone else out there who has experienced this.

Hawaiian Airlines attendants have been promoting an In-Flight Hawaiian Airlines Elite Mastercard Credit Card offer for years. They say the same speech on the plane every time. The offer is that you only have to spend $1 on the credit card in order to receive the 70,000 (or 60,000?) bonus points. Their standard offer is that you have to spend $2,000 in the first 90 days in order to receive those bonus points. But the flight attendants make it VERY CLEAR that the promotion is that you only have to spend $1 if you take the in flight offer.

I did that, spent over $1, and never received my bonus points. Here is the problem: When I called Barclays, the credit card company that backs the Hawaiian Airlines Mastercard, they say that the promotion they see attached to my credit card was an inflight offer, and that it is $2000 in the first 90 days in order to receive the bonus points. They told me their relationship with Hawaiian Airlines is black and white. They have no influence over what Hawaiian Airlines promotes, and cannot make any adjustments to bonus points. They are just the credit card company. So I went and called Hawaiian Airlines directly and spoke to a supervisor, who tried to send me back to Barclays, and who was of no help. She regurgitated scripted responses but eventually in conversation she admitted that she ""does not have access to the promotions"" and DID NOT KNOW about the in flight offer. She is a representative of Hawaiian Airlines, and did not know that employees of the airlines are promoting a special that they have been for years??? Make that make sense.

I am extremely frustrated. I want my bonus points. But that's now not even the main issue. The main issue for me is that the flight attendants are heavily pushing people to apply for a credit card with an offer that the company does not seem to know about. This seems incredibly fraudulent.

Has anyone else experienced this? I know there are those out there being scammed like I am. What should I do next to bring attention to this? I love flying with Hawaiian Airlines but this is messed up.",SwimmingCaramel4792,68,23,HawaiianAirlines

The agent found a 4/11 HA35 flight and we booked 2 extra comfort seats for an additional $200. Complaint was noted and we can call consumer affairs for a refund for having to pay this. So the worst part of this is our Airbnb will be empty tomorrow for around $500. We probably have to also pay for luggage which was originally free for our first class tickets. Would probably feel a little better if we were ever given a reason why the flight was cancelled other than the legal departments explanation of ""no plane"".

1avue10,2024-02-21 06:06:12,BEWARE: 50% off companion code,"I recently booked a flight for me and my husband LIH &gt; SEA and called today to try to change it to a day early (Changing from a Friday to a Thursday flight, same time). Come to find, if you use the 50% off companion code, you can't make any changes to the flight, or you will have to pay full fare and will essentially lose the 50% off companion discount completely! I was shocked &amp; checked [the website](https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/legal/promotermsandconditions/companion-discount) where the 3rd to last bullet point says ""Date and routing changes may be made with applicable penalties and must be done through Reservations department"" which I tried to use to support my claim to the reservations supervisor. Granted, it does say ""with applicable penalties,"" but shouldn't it be specific and say that means you completely lose the companion discount? The supervisor used the term &amp; condition ""Discount cannot be applied to tickets already purchased"" to support their claim, but I think that is some BS! To me, that bullet point means you can't buy a full-price ticket then try to use the companion discount after the fact. Really shady and plain trickery, if you ask me. Just a warning if you are planning on using your 50% off companion code. 

Honestly, I have had such difficulty working with Hawaiian Airlines customer service. They really are the worst :'( It really sucks that outsourcing customer service has brought their standards so low.

He’s doing the research and pricing because his family is 4 people (2 adults, 7yo, toddler) and we’re just 2 (adult/10 year old). So we’re go with the flow in this.

He’s priced at Main Cabin Basic.  We’ll be booking separately, regardless. Even if we booked all 6 on the same reservation, we wouldn’t be guaranteed to sit together.

But I can’t convince him to book Main Cabin, let alone pay extra for windows for the kids.

So … does Hawaiian do its best to seat the family of 4 together? Or how do I convince him to book Main Cabin? And upgrade to EC to get windows for the kids?

Otherwise, my kid &amp; I are flying how we fly with hubby … 1st on the Dreamliner.

1cnmd3v,2024-05-09 10:23:52,Any Advice ? ,"last year, I signed up for the Hawaiian miles credit card. The credit card and airline were running a promotion that if you signed up, you got a 50% off companion code, which means when you buy two round-trip tickets one is 50% off. I booked my ticket via the airline and realized they forgot to take 50% off one of the tickets. When I call the airline immediately after realizing this mistake, they told me unfortunately because I paid in full. There was nothing they could do to reimburse me half of one of the tickets, but would, send me a 50% off code for my next flight. I found this to be more than I found this to be fair and excepted that resolution. A year later, I am booking a flight to Hawaii for my honeymoon. My fiancé used our travel miles for one ticket and we decided that for the other ticket we would use the 50% off coupon. when I went to book, it would not let me use the coupon and when I called, I was told because they gave me another companion code. I went back-and-forth with the airline and told them I already met the terms for their companion code, which they failed to give me and I was told I would be getting a code for half off my next flight, not my companions. all of the customer service agents were completely useless, and all they had to say was that they are unwilling to honor what they originally offered. All I am asking for is what is mine, what they failed to award me in the first place. I can’t seem to get a hold of anyone in the US and I am running out of time to book my ticket. Any suggestions ! I have had nothing but unpleasant experiences with this airline and will definitely never be flying again with them after this. ",oliviave,13,1,HawaiianAirlines

1e0z4vx,2024-07-12 04:41:28,Is this a stupid idea?,"Going on a big family trip to Hawaii in June 2025.  Starting in Kauai and ending in Hawaii.  We are flying from Florida, which adds a bit of a kink to the plan.  

I would like to treat the family and fly HA into HNL or OGG in first class on an A330, then connect into LIH on the A321.  This would require a positioning flight to get to an HA city since they aren’t flying routes from near Tampa.  Also flight home would love to find an alternate lie-flat airline that we could do on a single ticket, without spending $4k per ticket on Delta One. 

On the A330 flight into Kauai, I am somewhat worried I would book the tickets and end up with an equipment change and not get that plane.  Specifically not interested in the smaller planes or 787.  Would have limited options to change cities if I had to do a positioning flight on a separate ticket.

Does anyone have advice on this situation?  And is HA first class really that special?  I want to do it to get the trip started off in extreme vacation mode, not feel like i am just flying another bland domestic FC leg.

I have a RT from Phoenix to HNL next week, and I was curious if they still offer a type of meal, snacks, or drinks? 

Do they offer a blanket also?

What are your experiences that I should prepare for? I'm an A-lister on southwest, so I'm very familiar with their product..

Just to add, I chose Hawaiian because I've never been on a domestic wide body aircraft before.

1fslloh,2024-09-30 10:47:36,PERTH - KAHULUI flights,"Hey everyone,

Has anyone flew from Perth all the way to Maui?

I have never travelled to USA and is now starting to plan my trip next year. I wanted to fly Hawaiian Airlines, so I had a look at their website to check the times/prices.

I noticed that they just have these options. It's either I choose a 4 hr layover in Sydney or a 2 hr layover.

However, the layover from honolulu is only 1 hr 55 and would that be too much of a stretch? e.g, not sure if i'll be picking up my luggage in honolulu or maui; immigration etc? 

Any advice is appreciated (as an anxious traveller lol) ",introvertangel,6,2,HawaiianAirlines
1g2sihx,2024-10-13 23:42:48,Flying with young kid with unassigned seat,"Hi

Travelling to LAX to Lihue with my family of 5 including a 7y old. I have called the airline today and they told me to talk to the crew once arriving in the airport to see if they could make sure that at least a guardian is next to our youngest kid.
Any advice?

I know I could pay for assigned seats but is it more than 500$ round trip and my take is that airlines have to do their best to have young kids next to a parent when possible.

Also I am not saying that people who paid for their seats should give up theirs, just asking about airline policy and support.
