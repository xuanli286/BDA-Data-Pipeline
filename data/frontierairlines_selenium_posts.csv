1bfs2g5,2024-03-16 07:41:22,My first really bad Frontier experience,"I’ve been very neutral on Frontier. I have bags specifically bought for Frontier, have a status match (so I can carryon 1 bag), and do discount den for the kids fly free. In about 10 flights we had one flight straight up cancelled but were able to rebook the next day no issue. 

This trip was “when things go bad they can really bad with Frontier”.  We had a 6am flight from Denver to Orlando and they switched to a smaller aircraft. They did send a generic email a couple hours before the flight that they were seeking people who would take an alternate flight for $250 vouchers. 

We were boarding group one so we start to board and then it happens. My wife, oldest child, and myself all scan green. Then my youngest scans red - no seat. So the agent just points at the desk and says “join the line” (which was probably 30 people deep).  

Apparently Frontier printed a list of people, which I was on who should NOT get seats until all other people without seats get theirs. Due to weather the boarding was delayed which really just drew out an awkward series of chaotic conversations.

One woman whose 4 year old son was already boarded explained she had to grab diapers and her kids and grandparents were already on the flight. The agent literally said “is there an adult with him?” and then told her to get to the back of the line. Only because the passengers banded together did they end up letting her on first. Otherwise she likely wouldn’t have got a seat. 

No announcements were ever made offering passengers a voucher to take a later flight. 

We didn’t make the plane and were rescheduled for the same flight the next day. It turns out that flight got straight up cancelled. We got an email to rebook which was broken. The app still showed we had the flight also, which was wrong obviously. After waiting 3 hours to talk to an agent, I was told the only flight was three days later and was a 16 hour itinerary with two layovers. 

Frontier said because the second flight was cancelled due to weather they weren’t accountable for any compensation or anything at all. 

We ended up burning a ton of United points to get out. The moral of the story - make sure your plans are flexible and know if things go bad they go very bad. ",hamiltonisoverrat3d,68,157,frontierairlines

Few weeks after booking they canceled one leg of our return from Costa Rica. So we now had no flight from Costa Rica to the US. Frontier refunded us some money for that portion of the trip, but refused to refund all of our money when we requested to cancel and rebook with a different airline even though we would have no flight out of the country flying with them. Spent hours on WhatsApp arguing with them because that's the only way you can get a hold of them. Frontier wanting to offer us a travel credit that we had to use by February.

1cb6dpz,2024-04-23 22:42:04,Baggage line worker at MCO lied to us,"This is just a long rant because of the amount of stress my body had to endure yesterday. 

My fiancé and I were flying out of MCO yesterday with a checked bag. It was our first time checking so I did some research and knew we only had a 1 hour window to check the bag. Flight was at 9:10, and baggage check was available from 7:10-8:10 and we arrived at 7am. I’m a cane user and when we arrived I was already in a lot of pain from our trip we had planned to arrive earlier but online it said TSA would take less than 30 min so I wasn’t too worried. We made it to the line by 7:05 which gave us 65 min to check the bag. The line was pretty long but I knew it wouldn’t take an hour. We approached the line and the frontier worker at the end asked to see my boarding pass. I showed her and she immediately started yelling at me.

 “You’re too late! You only have 5 min to check your bag and that is not a five minute line. They won’t take the bag and you’re going to miss your flight. You need to arrive at the airport 3 hours early. You better book another flight now.”

At this point my anxiety kicks in and my back pain is not helping. I know that’s the only flight to our airport that day and their most likely booked til later in the week. I try to ask about the luggage window ending an hour before take off not boarding but she cuts me off and tells me I’m wrong. “You can get in the line but you won’t make it.” Now other passengers have gotten in front of us in line and I’m panicking so I grab my fiancé and get on it. I wanted to ask her about ADA accommodations for the line, since it’s hard for me to stand on lines but I didn’t feel comfortable after she yelled at us. So for the next 30 min on line I’m researching flights and fees and hotels in a panic. We watched group after group be turned away with their baggage for missing the window. The only other frontier workers were behind the counter and slammed so we waited to find out if we were sol. 

Get to the counter and a very nice woman helped us. It was 7:45 and we still had 20 min left to check a bag. She tells me the other woman was wrong and I finally relax. Now I see why everyone complains about checking bags! 

We get through the TSA ADA line, take the tram, get a sandwich and make it to our gate 5 min after boarding should have started. The flight was delayed. We wait over an hour to board. Made it home okay with more stress and back pain than I needed. 

TLDR: frontier worker at baggage check said we were too late to check our bag and make our flight. If I had listened to her it would have cost me thousands for a new flight, rental car, hotel for a few nights, and days of work I would’ve missed. She lied, we had plenty of time for the bag and flight and then we ended up waiting an extra hour to board because of a delay. ",Comfortable_Doug_IV,69,180,frontierairlines
1bas2m1,2024-03-10 05:00:11,Feels like I won the Frontier lottery!,"Bought 2 non-refundable tickets for a trip where we didn’t need any bags because we were meeting somebody at the destination who was driving there and able to take our bags. Trip fell apart and I was just going to eat the cost of the tickets ($800). After reading many posts on this sub, I decided to check in for the flights and see what happens. Woke up to a delay this morning, ok still seems like the flight will leave today. After 2 more delays, they offered me a full refund or travel voucher. Obviously I took the refund for both flights! If we had planned on making the trip today, would have been super annoyed but instead I got the refund I wanted AND I learned my lesson and won’t be booking again. #winning

Flight got delayed. Supposed to leave at 950 pm. They don't let us board until 1130. Have us deboard at 130. Say our flight is delayed but not cancelled so no vouchers. I still have to go out and get checked bag and recheck. They won't let me recheck bag until noon since ""delayed"" flight leaves at 2pm so I can't get through TSA and I'm just stuck in boarding area. 

I'm told we'll get a five dollar food voucher but I was offered no food when stuck on the plane for two hours and no other accommodations. 

My first experience with Frontier and I will be sharing this whenever possible. There's unavoidable things yes but no vouchers or anything to make this experience just a little better is absolutely unacceptable. ",incognitios,52,107,frontierairlines

While I was boarding, some random mom shamed me, saying it must be nice to board early just for having a “difficult child”. Excuse me? Mind your own business.

195p79t,2024-01-13 22:30:11,"Paid for stretch seating, frontier changed the plane type","I flew to Cancun last week and selected exit row stretch seating in row 19 about 3 days before the flight. Upon boarding, I went to row 19 but it was just a regular row, and it appeared that the exit row on this particular A321 variation was in row 13. I alerted the stewardess and she was very nice and told me to stay in row 19 for this flight and to “make sure I get my refund at the gate upon arriving”. We landed in Cancun and we did not go to a gate, we instead exited on the tarmac and were bussed to the arrivals where there were no Frontier gate agents.

I contacted Frontier through the website chat feature and was told that there is no record of a plane change(probably because it is just a different seating arrangement of the same plane-A321). Because of this they basically told me that I am inept and did not book stretch seating and that I am a liar and am not going to receive a refund.

Upon getting to the gate for my flight back from Cancun, I spoke to the gate agents there and was treated horribly. I was very calm and asked them to look into the situation but the angry manager just told me no refund and walked away.

At this point, I feel that I paid for something that I did not receive. And I feel my only option is to reach out to my credit card provider and dispute the charge. Anyone have any other recommendations?

UPDATE:
Going through the frontier customer complaint link listed in the thread below worked. I was given a refund in less than an hour. It’s really unfortunate that Frontier’s chat feature and gate agents are so rude but at least they came through in the end.",wentzisthegoat,25,226,frontierairlines
1e7pot1,2024-07-20 15:02:07,Girlfriend was removed under threat of arrest from an overbooked Frontier flight 1449 from ATL-DEN after having already boarded.,"My girlfriend was forced off of Frontier flight 1449 under threat of arrest tonight due to overbooking after having already been seated on the flight on the way to a wedding. The gate staff then essentially just laughed at her and refused to re-book her at all on any flight that would arrive before the wedding, they also refused to provide any hotels or compensation. Frontier's chat support was also less than useless as usual.

Delta booked her on a standby flight for tomorrow morning so hopefully she'll still make it to the wedding in time.

From what I'm reading [here](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/bumping-oversales) what Frontier did was illegal as it states under the ""Can airlines involuntarily bump me after I have boarded the flight?"" that:

&gt; Generally, no.  If you have met the following conditions, airlines are not allowed to deny you permission to board, or remove you from the flight if you have already boarded the flight:
&gt; You have checked-in for your flight before the check-in deadline set by the airlines; and
&gt; A gate agent has accepted your paper boarding pass or electronically scanned your boarding pass and let you know that you may proceed to board.

It seems she may have been singled out since she's an immigrant traveling by herself so I suspect they thought they could just take advantage of her and bump her from the flight without any compensation. She's also a medical student which reminded me of [this incident from United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Express_passenger_removal) where a doctor was forcibly removed from a flight.

She did get some video/audio recordings of this as well and I think some other passengers were recording.

Has anyone dealt with Frontier threatening to have passengers arrested if they would not leave an overbooked flight? I couldn't find much information online about this sort of thing other than it supposedly not being allowed since most of what I see just deals with denied boarding situations rather than forcibly removing passengers.

Edit: All the Delta flights got delayed/cancelled so she's not going to make it at all.

Edit 2: I just got back from the wedding(that she missed) and now I know exactly why they kicked her off as someone at the wedding happened to be on the same flight that she was and witnessed what happened(I have their contact info as well). Frontier stole her seat to give to a crew member(presumably for repositioning reasons) as shortly after she was forced off of the flight a bunch of crew members took her seat and a few other empty ones. So she got kicked out for exactly the same reason as the [United passenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Express_passenger_removal). This case seems even more egregious in some ways as the witness confirmed that no offers were made for passengers to voluntarily leave the flight(United had offered $800 in that incident).

Edit 3: So it gets worse, when this was all happening another passenger had even tried to volunteer to give my girlfriend a seat on the flight they had purchased(the volunteer had an infant that they had bought a seat for and offered to hold the infant instead) however Frontier refused to allow her to use the seat offered by the volunteer(from the way my girlfriend described it Frontier refused to let her use the seat occupied by the infant due to having to recalculate the weights and balance for the flight if they did so).

Edit 4: Some strange contradictory statements coming from Frontier support ""I must kindly inform you that downgrades do give the authority to our airport team to remove passengers from the aircraft if it is needed. In this case, *girlfriends name* was explained by our airport team why she was not going to be able to travel as scheduled, being that she was the first on the list to be denied boarding.""",Lightsword,559,2078,frontierairlines

175yd6q,2023-10-12 12:34:48,Frontier needs a Class Auction Lawsuit for ignoring DOT rules,"I want to share my recent experience with Frontier Airlines, and it's been nothing short of a nightmarish ordeal. I've decided to post this in detail to shed light on the airline's practices, discuss relevant legal regulations, and suggest that passengers consider their rights in such situations.

On October 7, 2023, I was a ticketed passenger on Frontier Airlines flight 570 from Salt Lake City (SLC) to Denver (DEN). Little did I know that this journey would turn into an ordeal that would leave me shocked, disappointed, and deeply frustrated.

During the boarding process, I was involuntarily denied boarding due to an overbooking situation. I was more than willing to cooperate and accept rebooking on another Frontier flight or even on another airline to reach my destination. But it seemed Frontier's gate agents had a different plan. They not only denied me proper notification, which is required under 14 CFR Part 250, but they also refused to acknowledge essential passenger rights for me and for other unfairly bumped passengers.

Frontier Airlines, like all U.S. carriers, is subject to regulations set by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). These regulations exist to protect passengers in precisely the kind of situations I experienced. Among other things, airlines are required to inform passengers about overbooking, provide written statements of their rights, and ensure compensation in case of involuntary denied boarding.

In response to this disheartening situation, I made it clear that I was seeking reimbursement of the original fare payment of $253.96 and a cash compensation of $1,015.84 (400% of the fare), as outlined by DOT regulations on Transportation.gov.

Despite my repeated attempts to resolve the issue, Frontier Airlines issued me a $1,000 travel voucher, which I didn't request or desire. This experience left me with numerous questions unanswered, including why Frontier chose to discriminate against me and others and how they plan to compensate me for the expenses incurred due to their carelessness. Maybe it is because they saw I am a foreign national? Did they think I wasn't going to pursue this until the last consequences?

I strongly believe that passenger rights should be upheld, and airlines, including Frontier, must be held accountable for their actions when they fail to do so. The question arises: should the hundreds of passengers who have had similar experiences and posted all over the internet and also here on /r/frontierairlines consider collective legal action against Frontier?

In no way am I suggesting violence, but I do believe that passengers have the right to demand accountability and proper treatment. After all, this is not just about me, but anybody who commits the mistake of trusting Frontier.

I encourage you all to be aware of your rights as passengers, to educate yourselves about the relevant regulations, and to share your experiences and concerns so we can hold Frontier accountable and push for better treatment and respect.

[I guess it's my bad, for booking on an airline that has fucking son of Peppa Pig as CEO, sorry, I got confused, it's Barry L. Biffle who is so fat won't even fit on these tiny seats. ](https://preview.redd.it/qqgxs96p9ptb1.jpg?width=595&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=085da4a30898d3abc2c717546f5bd767e0f95a45)

Frontier canceled our flight (Denver-Tampa) yesterday. There was no emails,announcements, or any warning. Everyone found out when they got to the gate.

Went to the ticket counter, got new flights (Denver-Chicago-Tampa) for the next day (today) at 5am. 
We received food vouchers and a hotel voucher- great. 
Got to the airport at 3:30am, checked in bags, got to the gate and watched the captain and crew exit the plane.
We were then told our flight was delayed until 7:11, and we might have to change gates. 

At 7:13 the agent made the announcement that the flight was cancelled because of plane maintenance. 

Go back to the counter and watched agents scream at elderly customers, berated non-English speaking customers to “speak English, you’re in America”. 
When it was my turn, I was told the best option for me to get to Tampa would be to take a flight at 9  tonight (12 hour wait), have a layover in Dallas for 7 hours and THEN fly to Tampa at 8 am.
Oh, and we were not given any accommodations. I mentioned that I am traveling with my child who is special needs and the woman shrugged.

- Their “chat” option is simply a bot that redirects you to their website to change your flight if needed.

-Service agents are nowhere to be found at the gate to help. When they do eventually show up, they are rude and useless. 

-It is Frontier’s policy that once a flight has been “closed” they will not book you on that flight EVEN if it isn’t leaving for another hour and they have plenty of seats available.

We checked bags at the airport and heard an agent tell other passengers the flight was in fact oversold and fully checked in so we were relieved to already have our boarding passes. About 15 minutes before boarding we looked at our electronic boarding passes again and my son’s and husband’s suddenly both say seat 31E. Given the oversold situation we have to assume an agent saw duplicate names and gave away my husband’s seat AFTER WE HAD CHECKED IN.

The flight gets rescheduled like a week beforehand to be a 7:20 am flight Saturday morning to include a 4 hour layover in Orlando. Whatever, at least we get home around the same time, but sucks that we have to wake up at 4am.

We get to Orlando to learn that our plane has been replaced with a smaller plane, so 23 people have to rebook. They offered $300 to anyone who would rebook, and after like 45 minutes there's still 11 people too many. My fiance and I are unknowingly amongst these 11.

The plane gets boarded and we are told we will not be flying home. All 21 other people who weren't able to fly got rebooked on another flight Sunday morning, except for us. We were told the next available flight they could get us on (even with a layover) is at 10 PM ON SUNDAY.

This means instead of getting home around 7pm on Saturday, we'll be getting home around 3am Monday morning. My fiance and I both work Monday morning, and thanks to Frontier, we'll get a maximum of 3 hours of sleep.

I have a personal laptop bag which is little bigger than most common bag but is with in the dimension of what frontier recommends, i.e., 14”x18”x8”. We were returning from New York (LGA) to Dallas (DFW) after a wonderful vacation with family (me, wife, daughters- 1.5yo, 4yo, 9yo, brother-in-law, his spouse, and in laws). We had a flight at 10:50pm, and definitely the gate agent noticed my bag; it’s not my first time. The agent asked me to check the size in the bin they had. I had travelled so many times in frontier and I was 100% sure it would fit. I tried and it didn’t fit just by even less than an half inch, it was a surprise to me; in my more than 100 flights and numerous bin check, I never had this issue. I have DEN deals and always fly via Frontier DFW-DEN (convenient and cheap) for my work. I was not sure what went wrong because I had less stuff than what I used to have.

The agent asked me to pay $99 for the bag since it no longer qualifies for personal bag. Then I noticed the bin they asked me to test was of Air Canada. I requested the agent that the bin is different that is why my bag didn’t go through. The agent was adamant and said there is nothing wrong with the bin (basically said the size is same) and asked me to pay $99. I was trying to defend my best but the agent didn’t budge. And there was another agent who played scare tactics and closed the door and went inside saying that we can no longer onboard. Now the panic started specially with my wife, she nearly broke down to tears and asked me to pay the money and leave the matter. I looked back and the panic was visible in all the family members. All the happy face turned pale. The agent gave me last chance to pay and board. Because the situation changed drastically I paid the $99 fee and we boarded the plane. I felt so bad and disappointed.

Now comes the interesting part. Because the bag did’t fit, it was a mystery to me and I need to figure out why. It’s 3:30 am and instead of sleeping I am posting this, it is the proof how bad it hit me, whole flight i was thinking what happened there with the bag. Now I come and check the details, the Air Canada personal bag size is: 13”x17”x6”. That was sufficient enough size difference for my bag.

Now I think there must be lots of victim of this scam Frontier is running. Fortunately my brother in law recorded enough proof of it in today’s event.

What shall I do? Can I sue them; there must be lots of victim. They made me feel embarrassed and my wife panicked and cried; I felt so bad. It left a bitter taste for all of us after such a wonderful vacation. What do you guys suggest?

Sorry for the long post and thank you for reading.

UPDATE (10/11/2024): After few multiple tries, they refunded $99. Phew!

Lesson learned: Please check the bin if it is has correct dimensions and get the proof if not.",062bel313,83,63,frontierairlines

Added a cabin pet to my booking on the app ahead of time. Went straight to security after arriving at the airport with my dog (no need to stop at ticket counter or get any special tags), then made a stop at the outdoor deck pet relief area while waiting for boarding time. While boarding, the person scanning passes barely looked at my dog or carrier, I just scanned my pass and got on the plane. Flight attendants were extremely kind and didn’t make any fuss about my carrier extending out a bit towards my seat while in flight to give my dog a little extra room. I put my free personal item in the overhead compartment.

Highly recommend Frontier if you’re traveling with a cabin pet! I had read horror stories of other airlines making it hard on pet owners or even turning people away at the gate; I was so pleasantly surprised with my Frontier experience.",vavavm,40,31,frontierairlines

1bsuhog,2024-04-01 12:24:13,Ever hear of a plane almost tipping due to weight and incompetence? Ever see a drunk pilot dry to get a ride in the jumpseat? We did on a single flight.,"My wife, my 5 month old son, and myself just survived Frontier Flight 2430 from Las Vegas to Denver. Before we boarded, no one knew what to do with his stroller. The people at the counter said the gate would handle it. The gate said the check-in employees did it wrong. I had to mention to both parties that I had an email from Frontier a week earlier saying it was their job to do this on the departure before they would submit to helping us.

As we waited to figure out the stroller and child logistics, I smelled the intense smell of booze. I heard a staffer whisper, ""That pilot is intoxicated."" It was from a pilot trying to get a free ride in the jumpseat. Well, I thought, ""At least we aren't on a Boeing MAX."" As we boarded, they were getting security to address him. But wait there is more...

We finally land in Denver and are walking down the aisle with me carrying my son when an announcement is made to quickly deplane before the plane ""tips backwards."" I am not joking. I do not know how many flights I have taken (over 100 for sure), but I have never heard of this happening. How do you screw up the weight that severely? We made it off the plane without it tipping, but our stroller was broken. I had the pleasure of carrying a broken stroller across the airport. Not too happy as it is an expensive stroller/carseat combo.

1c4xvx6,2024-04-16 05:18:10,A JOKE OF AN AIRLINE!!,"I am actually shocked this situation happened, which is why I am never flying this shit airline again. 

I am from Denver and was visiting family over the weekend with my girlfriend. We arrived at the airport last night for our 7:43PM flight and proceeded to weigh our checked bag. 

We paid for the standard 40lb bag (also a joke), which ours ended up being 41. I took the bag off the scale to open it up and remove an item, when a Frontier employee quickly rushed over to tell me its over 40 lbs and something needs to be removed (you don't say!). I removed a pair of pants and put them in my backpack. 

When we get to the counter, I give my confirmation number which included both tickets for my girlfriend and myself. The lady at the counter said my girlfriends name, to which I pointed to her and said ""She is right here."" As she was a few feet away. To my surprise, the lady at the counter said, word for word, ""I just wanted to make sure your name wasn't *girlfriends name* as we aren't allowed assume or will be sued and harassed because that's what Californians like to do."" I am from CO and currently live in CA. We both looked at each other in utter shock that she had the audacity to say something like that, especially while on the job! With both of us now disgusted by the lack of professionalism, I then looked at the lady and said, ""are we free to go?"" She nodded and handed our documents back to me and we walked off. 

But wait, there's more!

When we were close to the gate on the far side of terminal A at DIA, Frontier decided to change the gate on us to the other side of the terminal, forcing everyone to run to the other gate. Guess when we got the notification. 10 minutes AFTER we had already started boarding!!

While zone 1 was boarding, there was an announcement stating a tire needed to be changed and everyone must de-plane (they never changed the tire!). 

After the delay, we started boarding again. I didnt buy a carry-on as it's highway robbery, and simply had a backpack. 

Just when I was ready to scan my pass and board, a Frontier worker literally grabbed my backpack to pull me out of line and said ""you need to measure that!"" I gave him this (are you serious?) look, and proceeded to measure it. It was maybe an inch too wide, to which the power hungry worker says, ""you can't board with that until you make it smaller."" I kind of gave this exhale of disbelief, and took my bag to a chair to pull the pair of pants I had previously put in, out. 

I went back to measure the bag and it fit. I pulled it out their measuring compartment and got in line to board. I looked at my girlfriend and said, ""What a dumb policy. I don't want to use this airline again.""

Well, the power hungy employee that pulled me out of line the first time, overheard me, and barked, ""you wanna keep up with the attitude and I'll pull your ass off the plane!"" I was so in shock that I audibly chuckled, scanned my pass, and boarded the plane without looking back. 

I have NEVER seen something like this. From start to finish, EVERY single Frontier employee we interacted with was aggressive, rude, and verbally abusive.

Thank you Frontier. You have made it incredibly easy to never use your airline again. You are an embarrassment. 

Do yourselves a favor...pay the extra money and fly Southwest or any other airline.

1. Book non-stop flights only. If Frontier doesn’t offer non-stop to your destination, choose another airline.
2. Be sure the dimensions of your personal item and carry-on are within Frontier’s size requirements. There’s always a chance of being sized at any airport.
3. Do not check a bag. There is high risk of your bag being lost and checking a bag increases your risk of missing flight due to long baggage drop off lines. Frontier’s policy is that checked bags can be dropped off no more than 2 hours prior to flight. 
4. Check in to your flight as soon as it opens. If flight is oversold, later check ins are bumped first.
5. If you’re traveling to a time sensitive event (e.g., wedding, graduation, etc), choose another airline. Alternatively, have a solid Plan B in place ahead of time (free cancellation rental car reserved, refundable backup flight booked).",Crazy-Cancel-8084,52,79,frontierairlines

1dnn7pk,2024-06-25 04:15:46,Frontier pulling some BS on me at the gate and won’t let me board.,"

 
DFW-DTW flight was to leave at 2:44 pm. I’m sitting at the gate since 2:30 pm when they make an announcement that the plane interior is hot from inside so all those standing in line stepped back and went to their seats.

At 2:45ish, they announce “good to go” so ppl are back in the line and start boarding. I usually like boarding last so I end up walking to the door as soon as the agent announces “final call, we will close the door once we scan the last boarding pass”.

As I walk to the door, he’s just scanning the last passengers in queue, and then tells me “sir you’re late, we can’t let you board right now, please step aside” and asks me to stand in the line with the 8-9 other passengers who haven’t been assigned a seat yet and are on standby as the flight is overbooked.

I show him my boarding pass and tell him “but I already have a seat assigned” and he says “yes but you were late”. I don’t understand what he’s talking about because I walked to the door right when he announced final call. He says I have to now stand last in the line and will only get a seat once the standby passengers get a seat. 

Now they assigned my seat to one of the bystanders and probably put me on another flight. They offered 4x compensation to all the others they rebooked, except me.

1em18pe,2024-08-07 11:06:19,False accusation of child trafficking on my Frontier flight ,"(So this is the email I sent them. Ask if you need more details. I don’t know what to do at this point.)

I am writing to discuss a case of blatant discrimination and a false child trafficking report I experienced at the hands of your staff and airline. 

On July 19th, 2024, my daughter and I took a Frontier Airlines flight from LAS to SFO (F9 4401), arriving in SFO around 9:45 PM. 

Upon landing and arriving at the gate, passengers were advised that our intended gate was still occupied by another plane. When we finally taxied to our gate, we were left on board and told that the gate needed a repair before we could leave the plane. After nearly an hour of being misled by the flight crew, we were all directed to take our assigned seats again. 

Once seated again, the flight crew made an overhead announcement to remain seated as law enforcement officers were boarding the plane. The police made their way down the aisle, eventually stopping at seats 32 A and B, where my daughter and I were. 

The officer looked at me and requested that I go to the back of the plane, as he needed to “talk to me about something.” I was confused, but complied and walked to the back, expecting him to follow. Instead, he began talking to my 9 year old daughter, deliberately beyond my earshot. My daughter later told me that he questioned our relationship and if she knew who I was. He then proceeded to walk to the rear of the plane where I was standing, and asked me to “explain a few things.” 

The officer said that a “child trafficking” tip came in. He said that they looked at the manifest and saw that my last name does not match my child’s, so they took the tip as credible. He berated me and forced me to prove that I am my daughter's biological mother. In doing so, I was forced to publicly out myself as transgender in front of him, the flight attendants, and fellow passengers.  

My daughter was finally allowed to join me after outing myself to his satisfaction. She was visibly terrified and is still traumatized by this incident. We both are. The officer proceeded to comment on my daughter's beauty, stating that she “needs to be careful because she could be trafficked/kidnapped because of how pretty she is.” This dialogue was extremely uncomfortable for my child and unbelievably inappropriate. We were not allowed to exit the plane until everyone else deboarded. The officer apologized for the situation and exited the plane behind us.

Following this incident, I performed some research and found that the “tip” the SFO PD was responding to came directly from your airline, per SFO PD’s Sergeant Gallo, while the flight was in progress.

Neither the airline nor any of the crew members apologized to me or my daughter at the time of the incident, and the “customer service” correspondence I have had since, has been extremely unsatisfactory. Not only was the delay in exiting the plane unacceptable, but this entire incident has been extremely traumatic, humiliating, and demeaning to myself and my child. 

As a marginalized individual, this false report made by your crew/airline was without a doubt based on discrimination and prejudice. I am a trans-masculine person traveling with my daughter. Can fathers not travel with their daughters? Can parents not have different last names than their children? My 10 year old niece has traveled on Frontier many times with only her stepfather. They have different names and this has never happened to them. They have not been stopped and questioned by police, or harassed because their names do not match. Crew members have not filed child trafficking reports against her dad because they do not share a name. 

If anybody had taken just 10 seconds to look at my and my daughter’s faces, they would have seen that we look alike. We look related, because we are related. This could have been avoided if anyone within your crew would have spoken to us. Instead, we were made victims of discrimination and harassment. This is more than just a training flaw and the airline should be held responsible for the distress we experienced.

I ask that Frontier Airlines evaluate how this situation occurred and how you can ensure that it never happens again. I would like to be made aware of said evaluations and procedures in airline reporting for human trafficking tips. Specifically, I would like to know exactly what it was that I did that prompted this trafficking tip to occur. Passengers have a right to feel safe and free from discrimination regardless of their gender identity, sexuality, age, religion, or ability.

Please consider the emotional distress and financial burden that this event has had and will continue to have on my family. My daughter was physically ill for days following the event and afraid to leave my side. Both my daughter and I are now seeking therapeutic care as a direct result of the emotional turmoil your airline has caused. 

When I reached out to your Customer Support department (CRM 0957364), they had a seemingly flagrant disregard for the gravity of the situation, and offered me 10,000 Frontier Airline Miles (valued at about $100) as the proposed compensation for the ""inconvenience,"" which, frankly is offensive. If I were only inconvenienced by a delayed flight, miles might make sense, but that is not the case in a situation leading to fear while traveling anywhere with my child and requiring ongoing therapeutic care. 

Please consider these effects and the gravity of the situation in your response. I hope to resolve this matter discreetly, but if necessary, I will file a formal complaint with the ACPD and pursue legal action. 

Thank you for your understanding in this difficult situation and I look forward to your response. ",unknownprospekt,899,2031,frontierairlines

Nearly all flights were delayed, usually by about an hour. I’ve thankfully never had a cancellation. Pro tip: the earlier in the day you fly, the less the likelihood of delays. 

Gate staff: hit and miss... Flight crew: always very friendly. 

Yes, their communication is terrible. Pro tip: download the FlightAware app and set up push notifications for your flight. Use the “where’s my plane” button to get a good idea of whether your flight will be delayed. 

Have I had better experiences on other airlines? Yes. 

Have I had worse experiences on other airlines? Yes. 

I only fly direct, never check my bags, follow the rules to the letter, and I check in the minute the window opens. It’s worked out well for me and allowed me to travel more than I would otherwise. 

You do get what you pay for, but if you do a little homework, have some flexibility, and are a generally self sufficient individual, it’s a great way to travel on a budget. ",mattopia1,13,53,frontierairlines

Get to gate ahead of time, boarding is ongoing. When I try to scan my valid boarding pass the agent tells me I actually don’t have a seat as the flight is overbooked. My seat was bumped as I “paid the least amount for my ticket” compared to the rest on the flight. Some people ended up not showing up so I was still able to fly, but any advice for if this happens again? Not understanding why me getting a deal means that I’m sold something that doesn’t exist.

1es6hfm,2024-08-15 00:44:02,A warning to travelers with double barrel last names ,"I have a double barreled last name with a space rather than a hyphen. Think ‘John Smith Green instead of John Smith-Green’. 

This is my first time flying frontier and they really messed me up today. My booking information was all correct, and my name was written correctly on every email and communication about my booking and check-in. 

For some reason, Frontier’s system decided to duplicate the first half of my last name into my middle name spot on my boarding pass. So my boarding pass said ‘John Smith Smith Green’. 

This broke my TSA precheck, since it doesn’t match my legal name and also made it impossible to get through the regular security line. 

Frontier told me they could only fix this error (an error wholly because of their own computer system) if I paid $75 because it’s a ‘security risk’. I’m not sure how $75 makes the risk of fixing my name to what I actually booked my ticket under go away, but that was the only assistance I was offered. 

So a warning if you have two last names - don’t fly frontier. ",sootpuffzy,27,76,frontierairlines

1exom0g,2024-08-21 20:41:38,Urinated on mid flight 8/21 - zero sympathy or reimbursement ,"My leg and 120 dollar Hokas were peed on during a flight. My eyes were closed and I opened my eyes and removed my headphones to see urine steadily flowing from the seat in front of me onto my shoe and leg. The human presumably had an accident. The people behind me witnessed it and made faces of disgust and shocked laughter. The flight attendant was very nice and allowed me to use the for crew use only bathroom to clean the urine off of me and gave me a bag so I did not have to sit in a pee shoe. I was told by three different frontier people to wait for the head of claims. She took 25 minutes to come out after having 3 people up front tell me that they already told her to come out. My ride was waiting for 30 minutes as I was waiting sticky with urine. Instead of apologizing or saying I'm sorry for your experience she said ""I am not the one who pissed on you, what do you want me to compensate."" At the very least, I wanted empathy and my flight refunded or some sort of frontier miles. Instead, I was treated like an animal. Getting peed on by another human and sitting in it is foul. How frontier handled it may be worse.


EDIT: To all who have their input thank you. Frontier just gave me a 75 dollar voucher which was nice enough and better than nothing. I was more upset with how I was treated and the tone in which I was spoken to. I understand that it was not technically the airlines fault. Deleting post soon because it's been as resolved as it will be and I don't want to give frontier bad press.

EDIT TWO: People seemed to be fixated on the employee only bathroom. There was a grown man passenger who was waiting for the restroom on the right while the restroom on the left was vacant. I asked if I could get by him to change and he pointed to the for crew use only sign. I asked the FA and she opened the door for me. This could have been the mutual misunderstanding about a ""for crew use only"" applying to not the lav but was misunderstood. Regardless, I am confused on why that detail makes my story fake. I mentioned it to show the special touch the kind FA showed me. If I cleaned off my leg and changed my shoe and sock in the regular bathroom, what difference would it make?

EDIT THREE: FRONTIER HAS REACHED OUT AND PROVIDED ME WITH A 200 DOLLAR VOUCHER. For everyone asking how I was peed on or what happened it is all included in the thread. I am satisfied that frontier realized that the customer service lady behaved unprofessionally, even if the urine was not frontiers fault. I'm satisfied with them reaching out and apologizing.

As we were cueing for the boarding process, it became quite clear that there was a hitch of some sort. As I scanned my boarding pass, the gate lady said “Oh, you don’t have a seat, please stand over there and we’ll explain in a few minutes.” After a chaotic hour of several other passengers panicking and screaming at the clown-show Frontier gate crew, we were informed that they had actually *switched jets* for our flight, and the *new jet* suddenly has 15 less total seats. So, there was a list of the poor souls that were kicked out of the flight. Guess whose name was at the top of the list? Yep. There were a few groups of parents that were about to physically attack the gate crew, because some of their young kids were already seated, but the parents were booted off the flight too! This is an international flight, so their children are just going to have to deal with being in a foreign airport SOLO (they’re probably under 10 years old) until their parents are actually able to make it. One guy was basically ready to knock a Frontier gate guy’s teeth out and go to jail. I was just trying to remain calm, since explosive anger at a time like this is usually the idiot’s option. But it was quite a scene. So, my situation was eventually resolved with as much pain as possible in comparison to my original relatively short direct flight. I’m stranded here until my NEW flight leaves at midnight (12 more hours to wait here), then arrives in Tampa at 6 AM, and then another 8 hours to kill until the final leg, getting me to my destination, CUN, arriving at 4:00 PM *TOMORROW*. Then I received their pathetic voucher, which is a $250 credit towards another clown show Frontier flight. I’m extremely despondent at the moment, and the anger I feel is almost too much. But, I have to grit my teeth until *TOMORROW*. Without any reasonable cash payment for some amenities that I can utilize to distract myself from the grinding reality that Frontier cynically screwed me out of my 4 months in advance purchased ticket, checked bag and seat. I’ve told myself many times in the past *I’m never flying this worthless airline and dealing with their dog-brained staff ever again*, but I never dreamed it would reach such an astronomical level of absurdity to drive that final stake in the heart.",fentyboof,64,35,frontierairlines

1b9ssg5,2024-03-09 00:49:42,Frontier Airline Possible Scam by Airline,"We did everything right, came 2 hours early, and checked in the day before. Went to our gate. We had our tickets down for d7 along with 40 other passengers. The flight was delayed due to weather, and we sat in the d7 gate for an extra 2 hours. That was fine. However, there was no attendant at the gate and no information besides the travel board and the screen at the gate showing that the flight was delayed till 8:30pm to leave. Then, the plane listing disappeared off the travel board. A bunch of passengers waiting at the gate were super confused and we had nobody to ask. We eventually went over to e20 the gate that was the gate the plane left. We found out that they only made announcements of gate changes at e20 which didn't make sense because they had gate d7 listed previously. We brought photo evidence of the lack of information and they told us they couldn't do anything and that we had to exit the airport and go deal with the booking and check-in desk. One lady told me to fuck off (not actually) but she was basically like I'm not going to help you unless you pay a 600+ rebooking fee. We went over to the supervisor and she was like I understand when we showed her all the evidence. She was silent and didn't make eye contact. She knew something was up. The airlines also hinted that they knew that some people had tickets to d7 and they specifically said they only made announcements at gate e20. The supervisor knew they made a mistake, but to Frontier, we are just their bottom line. it also prevented people from getting refunds up to 400 percent of their ticket's worth because technically we missed our flight. Some legal loopholes/ grey areas to probably deal with an overbooked flight to save on cost. We eventually found one helpdesk person who was kind enough to rebook us on a flight two days later than we were supposed to leave because everything else was already overbooked due to delays from the weather. Thank god for her. She saved our lives cuz I wouldn't have found 600+ dollars as a college student for me and my gf flights back to LGA. FYI the people behind the counter can always rebook you at no cost, whether or not they do it is up to them. The supervisor was just a shady pos. BTW our flight was for March 7 DFW to LGA.

So originally my flight was $202 per ticket.  I had everything in, clicked “purchase now”, and somehow all of my passenger information disappeared.  With selected seats for 3 passengers, the price was around $750. 

I restarted, entered my desired flight info, and then the price was $254.   Thinking that couldn’t be right, I opened a new browser and tried again. New price $300+. 

I tried a private window on my browser thinking some cookie was making it go nuts.  New price - for the exact same flights as before - now $350+ per ticket.  I’m cursing now. 

I shut everything down, restarted my pc and tried again from scratch. I got a $290 or so price and figured I better take what I could get. This time it worked.

Peaches let out a single 'woof' and stayed in place--did not break command. I know the 'woof' should not have happened but ever since the 2 year isolation it has been a journey to get her back. I must stress, she did not move.

I was called to the desk and they said they were pulling me off the flight because of my 'violent dog'.  I was so confused. I explained the situation and that my dog may have made a single bark but she in no way lunged or even moved.

The flight attendant said I can just change my ticket to sometime later (next flight was the next day). I asked for evidence my dog was violent and suspected they did it because they were way over booked. She became irate and said I was accusing her of lying (she was) then banned us from ever flying on the airline again.

1bq2ugb,2024-03-29 02:29:38,My experience with Frontier and why I would still fly again,"Just got back from a trip with frontier. After booking the flights I stumbled across this subreddit and was pretty concerned about what would happen.

Flew MDW to SFO with a 5ish hour layover in DEN. 

On the way back did SFO to PHX (no plane change) to ORD.

First off. Every single leg was delayed. Once due to maintenance and the other three due to late arriving aircraft. Ended up being about 1-1.5 hours late each way. So not ideal but not terrible. Didn't seem like other airlines at those airports were having the same issues and based on how boarding a frontier flight goes... I'm putting that on them. 

Me and my wife flew cheapest possible. Only a backpack, no selected seats so on. And it went fine. Our backpacks were sized on 2/4 legs without issue because we measured them and made sure ahead of time. 1/4 legs the gate agent  asked to look at the bag but then waived us through. 1/4 legs our bags stayed on the plane while we got off for a crew change. Moral of the story id your bag is the right size you won't have problems. The number of people with insanely large bags complaining about paying was kind of hilarious. They make it critically clear what you need to do.

Same goes for boarding. The number of people the gate agent had to turn away due to not being Zone X was insane and massively slowed down the process. Especially once they got turned away, came back at the correct time, then got sized and had to pay. 

2/4 flights me and my wife did not get seated together. While annoying we knew this was a possibility going in and again they make it clear that could happen. 

Overall. Frontier seems to be the definition of fuck around and find out. 

Onto price. For our route/dates our options were United/Delta (direct) or the above Frontier options. Everyone else was 2+ stops. Delta/United wanted ~$550 for basic economy round trip per person. We payed $187.5 per person on Frontier. Can't argue with that at all. 

All in I'd say if Frontier is 50% or less the price its definitely worth it assuming you can backpack travel.

1furclh,2024-10-03 05:17:32,First time Frontier Flyer,"Booked a round trip flight from DFW to SFO for $95 and it was worth it for me. I was visiting family there so I shipped a box of clothes by UPS for $16 as I could leave it with my family the next time I visit.

Took just a backpack that fit the personal item sizer at 18” x 14” x 8”. I read agents don’t want you to force the bag in so I brought straps just in case but it now seems unnecessary unless your bag really is too large to fit. That being said, I saw an agent allow someone to try and forcefully stuff their bag into the sizer.

Had an 8am flight from DFW that was uneventful and departed on time. Landed in SFO about 10 minutes early. At DFW I clearly saw people that had some backpacks that wouldn’t fit into the sizer unless some items were removed but they were not checked. So it just goes to show, it’s a draw of luck with agents so if you know your bag is bigger, it’s a risk you’re taking.

On the return flight to DFW from SFO leaving at 10:40am, it was also on time and smooth. A gal with a backpack that was totally overstuffed where it’s was something like 16” x 14” x 16” was trying to jam her backpack into the sizer. It basically was half way in. The agent told her if it’s clothes, take them out and wear them. She took out 2 jackets and a small blanket, then got her bag to fit and boarded. Landing to DFW was on time and flight itself was also uneventful.

For $95, it was unbeatable. For an under 4 hour trip, the seats were fine… neither comfortable nor uncomfortable. The staff on the planes for both legs were courteous and smiled, they seemed better than Southwest or United flights that I’ve been on lately.  I would definitely fly again as long as it’s not a time critical trip. If it was critical, as others said, book refundable back up ticket with another airline if you’re looking for the lowest price and can travel light.

1bgq04k,2024-03-17 13:21:58,This airline truly is dedicated to the worst service possible,"Frontier has one goal and one goal only: to offer the worst possible service it can dish out while wrapping its customers helicoidally around a central shaft. Their ""customer service"" is even less usefull than used toilet paper and the only reason that it is 100% chatbot driven is so that they can pray on the less savy while ignoring even the most basic DOT rules. Flying in a portaporty with wings is better than setting foot in a Frontier plane where surly flight attendants actually give you attitude because you order a drink that you pay for, which means they actually have to do something. And if Frontier can combine this with canceling your connection mid-flight and dump you at an airport you were only supposed to switch planes they have managed to have, in their view, a glorious day.",slamsubtoil,42,106,frontierairlines
1f9cvot,2024-09-05 11:31:42,Forgot to pay the “don’t spill your drink on my luggage” fee,"I'm tired (in general) and tired of stupid people so I just need to complain for a second. 

Flew out this morning on Frontier. Stoner kid in front of me set his full Stanley cup behind his feet and promptly fell asleep. As anyone with two brain cells would expect, the cup tipped over on takeoff and absolutely saturated my backpack. He was not remotely apologetic but (silver lining) at least it was just water. A lot of water, but only water.

Had a meeting, flew home on Frontier - same seat, but a different aircraft (I checked).

Upon landing the second time I see that my backpack AGAIN has a large wet spot. Smaller than this morning, so - yay? But unfortunately this time it's also very sticky. 

Anyway, I think planes should have cup holders like gate area seats and I also think I'm going to start putting my bag in a trash bag every time I fly because I'm just over it right now.

1aupaxe,2024-02-19 23:00:59,The absolute nightmare of an airline,"I was so afraid of booking frontier because of all the horrible stories and they are in fact true. Our flight from Philadelphia to SJU was easy peasy and I thought ok maybe it’s not that bad of airline, this is something that can be an option. But holy sh*t did I eat my words trying to get back. We were stuck in the airport for 14 hours. Checked in early for our 11:26 am flight and got a text flight delayed 1 hr 45 min. Okay not bad, then another text delayed another 35 min. Then the flight comes and they say a passenger punched a flight attendant, leak in the bathroom, oh and now crew expired. All this information from people going up to the desk and yelling because the workers did not communicate ANYTHING! So they switch us to a 9:28 pm flight, which is a delayed flight from 1 am that day already. And some people were waiting for our current flight from the day before, so tensions are high. At this point, it is about 4 pm after the back and forth and waiting in line. Texts immediately, flight delayed to 10:15, 10:32, 11 pm, 11:27 pm. People making friends to leave the airport and come back to get diapers, baby food, etc. The plane is here, we’re all waiting. They say get your boarding passes ready. Worker comes on the mic, please remain calm. “Oh pilot says he’s sick, flight canceled.” Holy f*cking sh*t! At this point we are losing it and most people are too and multiple families like ours with small children. They say okay we’re going to put you back on your original flight which was delayed 14 hours, 11:36 am originally leaving at 2 am. We have a captain, have to wait on a crew. Crew comes, people are literally cheering when they see a crew. We finally make it, everyone exhausted. 

Asked multiple attendants at gates, do we have to do anything with our checked bags? “No, they’ll automatically be transferred over.” Okay. Arrive in Philadelphia. Nobody’s bags came. Like 3 bags on the conveyer belt, I kid you not. I let a local family borrow our car seat since they had checked theirs, just so they could get home safely with their baby, since luckily I kept ours with us the whole time. 

They send us email vouchers for future flights, like hell fucking no I will never fly frontier again. So what recourse do I have to get cash back? Also will I ever get my bags back? We shall see. 

It was just awful, no communication. That I think was the worst part, they wouldn’t make announcements to tell everyone what was happening. No updates, tell us our options. All of us just waiting, losing our minds and being herded like cattle from gate to gate with no guarantees on if we were ever leaving. 

And the worst part is these tickets cost the same amount with every little thing adding up. I still ending up spending about $2000 for 3 tickets. I only booked frontier in the first place because it was the only one that had direct flights from
PHL to SJU and back. Everything else had layovers. And the direct American flight was $1000/ticket. ",ShoweredBlueBlazered,92,451,frontierairlines

1dhafmh,2024-06-16 23:47:28,I got gaslighted by Frontier and won ,"Because of policies unique to Frontier airlines, and in addition to 36 hours of travel delays, myself and others on my flight experienced how these policies are used by Frontier to deceive customers in their relentless pursuit of cutting costs.  More specifically, I will describe how Frontier attempted to gaslight me so they would not need to provide hotel accommodations and how I was able to expose the deception of the representatives and receive the compensation.

I assume that their misguided strategies often work because of the complexity of their policies and the lack of transparency. I understand this is a long post but the conditions involved are not simple and, as I said, people get exploited because they don't understand them.

For a little background Frontier is the only airline in the [DOT cancellation and delay dashboard](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-cancellation-delay-dashboard) that does not always offer hotel vouchers for passengers who are delayed overnight due to a fault of the airline but there are some situations where the airline is responsible for the hotel.

According to their policy an example of where the customer is eligible for hotel compensation would be when they are waiting at the gate, their travel plans are delayed overnight, and the delay was due to a fault of the airline like a mechanical failure. If the flight was cancelled more than 24 hours in advance or the delay is due to something like weather that is not the fault of the airline, then the customer is not entitled to compensation.

I was originally booked on a direct flight 1951 departing Jun 13, 2024, from MCO to DFW. This flight was canceled on June 12, and I was rebooked on 2251 departing June 13 and connecting through Cleveland. It’s disappointing that my direct flight was downgraded to a connecting flight, but no hotel or meal accommodations are provided in this case because the flight was canceled with over 24 hours’ notice and rebooked for a same-day departure.

On June 13 I was waiting at the gate for flight 2251 to depart. After some delays due to mechanical issues the flight was canceled due to unspecified reasons and all the passengers were sent back to the ticketing area to rebook flights. It was 11am but there were no same-day options available to get me from MCO to DFW and so I was rebooked on flight 1757 departing June 14 for Cincinnati.

The representatives said that myself and all the people originally going to DFW were not entitled to a hotel voucher because they don't offer compensation when a flight is downgraded or canceled for uncontrollable reasons.  Being confused about what they meant I had to leave and do some research.

The change from my original booking from 1951 to 2251 was a downgrade because it was a same-day departure, and they were using the original booking as a proxy to deny responsibilities related to the cancellation of my rebooked flight. In other words, they were making a hidden argument that I am only entitled to compensation based on my original booking even after they canceled that flight and rebooked me.

Assuming their proxy argument is nonsense then if 2251 was cancelled due to controllable reasons I should be entitled to a hotel voucher, but they had said it was ""uncontrollable"".  This statement seemed to conflict with a notification I received earlier that 2251 was delayed for mechanical reasons and it would seem likely that it was canceled for the same reasons. Unfortunately, there is no public record of the reason for cancellation and only the representative has that information. 

I had to ask a very specific question: Why was flight 2251 canceled? They tried to misdirect me saying that my original flight was canceled for uncontrollable reasons, but I kept asking about 2251. It was at this point that they realized that they were busted for trying to gaslight and so they issued me a hotel voucher and I was probably the only person on the flight who got one.",JulesTex,6,33,frontierairlines

16mcuwd,2023-09-19 08:53:54,What the HELL Frontier? Has anyone experienced this and can you share your story?,"So this happened on Thursday of last week. I had a flight from Atlanta to Denver with a sixteen hour layover. My first flight had no problems and I slept in the airport so I could catch my next flight home to Salt Lake City. I had checked in with my previous flight and since flying with frontier I’ve never had to check in again for a connecting flight. The App would not allow me to check in and I believed that everything was in order. I went to the gate when boarding began and was stopped because apparently I had never checked in.

What?

I was shocked and then asked what I could do since I need to go home. I had my dad waiting for me at the airport and had a checked bag already boarded on my flight. The attendants at the front were exceedingly rude. They rolled their eyes and huffed before telling me I could board IF they had a seat available. By this time they had already had volunteers to take another flight because they overbooked. I panicked and waited. I wasn’t the only one having this problem. A woman had problems with her ticket as well, along with a couple, and they were allowed to board but when I asked if they had any other seats the attendant simply shooed me away. 

“We’re done boarding. There are no more seats. Bye.”

She refused to say anything more and I was left panicked and unsure of how to proceed. I called my family and eventually went to another frontier desk to ask for help. At this point I was crying. I was stressed and tired, I slept on the floor and was cold, I just wanted to be home!

Luckily the woman at the desk was kind enough to direct me to the customer service desk. Once I got to the customer service line I had to wait for two hours to speak to someone (I would have been home in that time) and they had very few people at the desk to help the massive amount of people having problems.

I got to speak with two wonderful women who had missed their flights as I waited and I hope they got to their destinations alright. 

Eventually I got to the desk and the woman meant to help was the complete opposite of helpful. She was just as angry as the two attendants at the gate and demanded how I could let such a thing happen and that the entire situation was obviously my fault. How dare I not ask for help when I did not even know I needed help in the first place?!

I worked in customer service and I know how terrible it can be. I try to be as kind and professional as I can since I know how hard dealing with people can I be but she tested my limits. I had never come so close to losing my temper but my anger turned into defeat when she demanded I pay a $99 fee to get on the next flight to Salt Lake. 

I had to call my parents in tears to ask for help since I did not have enough to cover the fee. In the meantime a couple with their son came to the desk and received the same condemnation I got. How could they miss their flight due being stuck in the TSA line? It’s their fault! They had to pay $300 to get another flight. There was a woman who had been at the airport for three days waiting for another flight since she had been booted from the first one and she was in line because they booted her again!

I watched various couples, single flyers, and the like continue to be berated and talked down to as if they were children. With my parents help I paid the fee and stressed the next ten hours I had to wait because I believed I’d be booted of this flight as well! 

Luckily I managed to come home but I had to call my manager to tell him I could not be at work the following day, my dad had to miss work to pick me up at 2 in the morning so he also had to call out! Not to mention how stressful the situation was. I had never been treated so poorly by a business. 

I plan to call customer service to see about a refund but if that can’t be arranged I plan to file a civil law suit because I witnessed I was not the only one who went through this. I was not the only one forced to pay a huge fee just to come home when I wasn’t the one who fucked up ( the App and overselling the flight). 

I just want to gather evidence that this wasn’t just some small one off thing. And if it was? I’ll drop it and take the ‘L’.

We have Aging parents going through a very stressful move and and others that are very permanently ill. Possibly last Christmas.  our return flight was last night. 7:52 pm the young lady at the boarding gate checking tickets was obviously angry about working on Christmas and she decided to take it out on the passenger's. She double checked dozens..of people's personal items to make sure they fit in the little metal bag check. My wife has a little under the seat bag made specifically for under the seat. She charged  us $100 because it didn't fit standing upright it fit when I put it in upside-down and we flew with it Saturday no problem. It's never been a problem it fits under the seat in front of us. But she did this to dozens of people it was just plain hateful spite.

So I recently flew Frontier from DEN to LAS, and honestly... The people not following the frontier policies were out of hand.

Every single person who got called out for their bags didn't actually fit the sizers! People pretended to be confused when they weren't allowed to waltz onto the plane with two full sized carry one for free... 

Two people tried to board during zone 2 priority boarding and were sent to the back of the line because they had the cheap tickets.

After the 10 minutes of delays thanks to stupid passengers I finally was able to board the plane. All I could think was ""those Karen's are going to bitch up a storm from this morning and not even acknowledge they were the problem."" 

So here I am, defending Frontier. It's a budget airline with really strict policies. But the policies aren't secret. They're publically displayed and you're reminded of them pretty frequently when you buy a ticket. If you follow the rules and you're polite you normally won't have any problems.

We see a line forming, figure its vouchers or similar. About 20 mins after announcement I realized people were BOARDING. I went up to ask the agent what was up and she said flight is not canceled so we board cancel our other booking. 

As we're boarding we realize, it had been a JOKE!?! The gate agent thought it would be FUNNY to tell 75 tired frustrated people that their plans were screwed! Confirmed this talking to other passengers. 

We finally landed at 1am but car rentals were closed, no hotels had availability, slept in a Denny's booth until rental opened. Delays aren't always the airline but are also NOT A JOKE!!

Follow up Return Flight:

We arrive 2 hrs early and are told our flight is canceled. Fortunately, there's a flight out of West Palm that we barely catch after a $100 high-speed Uber ride. While riding, I checked my emails: at 5:30pm, I got a $100 voucher on a future flight and an apology with no mention of WHY. At 7pm I had received the cancelation notice, 1.5 hrs after I was given the voucher!?! As I was driving back from the Keys at the time, I wasn't watching my email.

The good news, the flight from West Palm was remarkably smooth.

But future flight? Uhh, who is going to book with a company that uses their own screw-ups as a tool to drive more business? How about waiving some of my baggage fees? ",Substantial-Ball3916,96,2596,frontierairlines
1cac53j,2024-04-22 22:24:44,NEVER FLY FRONTIER~ ,"Stay away from Frontier!  These guys are ruthless!  Horrible! We were bumped in Orlando and they said it was our fault because we were late to the departure Gate.  They said it was our fault because we were the last booked on the flight, bottom line it was their fault!  We actually paid their fee of 25 dollars a person to book us on the flight because we wanted to make sure we were booked into the flight without any issues.  There were 8 of us, we all arrived at the gate at the same time.  My wife and granddaughter were able to board the plane-but we were told to step aside while everyone else on the flight boarded.  Gate closed and we were now separated 2 on the plane and 6 still in Orlando.  When they realized the fact that my wife and granddaughter were on the flight it became quite obvious, we were all together and not late to the gate.   Then they said were not booked on the flight, at which point I explained that we paid for the agent to book us onto the flight... so they were out of options and excuses, and decided to admit that it was an agent error.  This admission occurred after standing in a line for over 2 hours at which time we told this same story to more agents, they good copped, bad copped us with a couple of agents there, and finally booked us on a flight the next morning.  Federal laws have regulations to protect passengers from this sort of treatment, however - oddly, they don't apply to Frontier.  We paid for our own food, and hotel - and yay, made it back to our home destination a day later than planned.  So... Why is it that Frontier is above the law and do not have to follow mandated laws... such as 4x payback for overbooking and subsequent bumping?

18d0jif,2023-12-08 01:21:57,Denied a seat due to overbooking and Frontier won't give me a refund. Next steps?,"Hoping someone on this thread can provide next steps as I am not sure where to go.

I booked a flight on Frontier over Thanksgiving and when I went to check in the morning of the flight, they said ""No seats available, please see agent at the front desk"". I did not get a boarding pass. I showed up to the airport on time, went to the ticketing desk out front and they said they overbooked the flight and there wasn't a seat available for me. She said ""You can take another flight which would get you to Philly tonight (10+ hours later) or fill out this form for a refund"".

As my trip was short, it didn't make sense to take the later flight so I went home and filled out the form for a refund. They are now repeatedly denying my request as I was a 'no show' on the flight. The customer service is responding to every email with the same text, regardless of what I say. They aren't answering my questions.

I have filed a complaint with the DOT as they did not follow guidelines regarding overbooked flights, but I am not hopeful that will work as I have no proof any of the above happened (other than my repeated attempts to check in, which only Frontier has in their records and I doubt they'd share that).

Are there any ways to follow up on this or escalate? It seems crazy that they won't give me a refund because they overbooked the flight, didn't give me a seat, and the lady at the airport desk gave me different instructions than the online reps.

I would file a chargeback on my card but have read that Frontier can ban you - does that actually happen? $150 isn't worth that since their flights are so much cheaper lol

UPDATE: After a month and a half, I was able to get a refund. They denied the DOT complaint, but I dropped it at that as I got my money refunded. 

I was able to make progress with the chat on their website, which I had to threated complaints with the DOT in order to get escalated to higher up department. Even that was initially rejected but after pushing back on a new email thread, I was able to get my refund.",swimjo,82,243,frontierairlines

I had to go to Chicago for a business meeting, wanting to save a little money I booked on Frontier, I paid extra for my checked bag round trip and thought it must be a good deal. 

I couldn’t check in on line and was told I had to check in at the airport. I arrive 3 hours ahead of my scheduled flight, wait in line and the agent welcomes me. I’m waiting for my board pass and she tells me it’s a $45 fee for a seat assignment, I tell her just put me anywhere on the flight. Her look was burning lasers, she says “for you to have a seat assignment it’s $45! “ I say, it’s ok I’ll just either stand or sit in the bathroom. The laser stare again, I look and say “call your manager please.  

Manager arrives and tells me I still have to pay for a seat assignment! 

I ask: “I purchased a ticket with a carry on bag from Seattle by to Chicago, I don’t care where on the flight you sit me, I paid for a spot on the plane, just issue a boarding pass and I’ll be on my way. Please explain why you are charging me for something I already paid for? 

The manager types something in the computer and hands me a boarding pass. They even gave me an asile seat.

Hi. I saw that your policy to travel alone is that you must be at least 15 years old. I also saw that everyone under 15 is required to travel with an adult or guardian. In my case, I am 16 years old and my sister is 14, meaning she is below the age required to fly solo.

Because I am considered as an adult flyer on your airline, could I be the person that accompanies her because I am 16? I know that if it were just me I could go by myself, but does someone know if I’d be able to count as her “guardian”?

1. $300 of frontier voucher
2. 15,000 Miles

Or I can sue them in small claims court for $189. I'm not sure which small claims court to sue and how to serve the papers, which will be a lot of effort.

So what should I do?

edit - the reason to cancel the flight was a ""controllable"" aircraft maintainance, I found that out through the DoT complaint.

I was not offered any alternative flight on any day, frontier contract of carriage requires frontier to book me in another flight.

Edit 2- I was afraid that the voucher will only cover the base fare that can sometimes be less than $1 and the rest is “taxes and fees”, so when I confirmed from frontier whether my voucher will cover the taxes and fees they replied that usually it doesn’t but my voucher will but will be single use. So finally I agreed to get a $300 voucher for my trouble.

  
Edit 3- the voucher was $300 and not transferable (my name must be on the reservation but there can be more than 1 people in the reservation), so I booked a flight for me +1 in one reservation and the total cost was $317, I applied the voucher and paid $17 using my cc",Alternative-Ad4581,72,73,frontierairlines

This past Saturday, we were traveling back home from Fort Meyers to Denver and we made the terrible mistake of booking our flight back home with Frontier. First, we had booked a flight that had a layover in Dallas for like an hour, it wasn’t too bad. We’ve flown to Florida before (on Delta and United) direct flight and flights with 1 or 2 hour layover and we actually liked the layovers more because it seemed more comfortable for our baby to make a stop and stretch and all that since it’s an almost 4 hour flight. Frontier cancelled that flight 2 days prior with no explanation, they just apologized for the cancellation and we didn’t think much of it then so we just rebooked with them, worse mistake. We got a flight with a 3 hour layover in Cleveland, which sucked but it wasn’t that bad but after we got to Cleveland they delayed our flight for another 3 hours (or actually, 2:55 hours and they made it clear we wouldn’t get compensation because they didn’t delay it by 3 hours or more). We had no option but to wait so we did, my husband worked on his computer for a bit, I walked around with our baby and she slept for a while, we got food, walked around together, got some coffee and then an hour before our flight we see the screen with the flights saying our flight is cancelled (along with like at least 4 more frontier flights), we were confused cause we weren’t notified through email, text, or an announcement so we went to the gate and the staff there had no idea the flight had been cancelled but soon after confirmed it and said they didn’t know why it was cancelled and said we needed to head out to the check in counter and ask to be rebooked or a refund and we were assured we would get a full refund. My husband decided to go and I stayed in case we could find a flight the same night so we didn’t have to go through security again. He waited in line for an hour, the line was full of people who got their flights cancelled after getting several delays. Once my husband reached the counter, the staff there told him they could get us a flight the next night with a layover but it was 9 hours long with a layover in LA and they assured him we were eligible for a full refund but they weren’t trained to process refunds so they gave him a card with a QR code to request the refund online… an HOUR just to give him a card and they refused to get us a hotel or help us get one, saying that’s not something they do. We decided not to rebook with them and rebooked through United, costing $1,400 plus $100 for a hotel, Frontier only gave us a $100 flight voucher and a $30 food voucher that had to be used writhing 24 hours. It took us another 5 hours to get a hotel because, surprise, surprise… WE GOT STRANDED IN CLEVELAND THE SAME NIGHT AS A ROLLING STONES CONCERT so every hotel we tried was booked, it was incredibly hard and expensive to get an Uber and all the prices were super high. Frontier still refused to help us and honestly, with a baby, sleeping in the airport was our last resort so after 5 hours we were just relieved to have a place to stay the night. Yesterday we got back and I contacted Frontier to get our refund, they said we couldn’t get a refund because their system showed we boarded the flight, THE ONE THEY CANCELLED???? I ended up going to their page commenting over and over and chatting with their support on Facebook, they told me they could get me a partial refund because they did take us to Cleveland, I asked to speak to a supervisor and then noticed I couldn’t message them anymore… they blocked me from their page!!! I wasn’t rude or anything, I was explaining my issue the same way I am right now and they blocked me. I am extremely disappointed and I will try to continue to comment on all their social media platforms because it’s not fair.
The fact that they have cheap prices shouldn’t justify that they do their job so poorly. I really hope they go out of business.",AffectionateMode7529,20,61,frontierairlines
1d7a46t,2024-06-04 01:27:41,Flight canceled because of tornadoes - what do I do?,"I normally fly private (G5) from my house in Malibu to my winter home in Aspen. 

I go to scan my boarding pass, the gate agent says my bag is too big for a personal item. (Mind you it’s only 4’ x 6’ x 19’) and I need to pay the carry on fee. Wtf!?

Don’t they know how often I fly? I told her I know the rules. She asks why I didn’t pay for a carry on when I had 3 separate opportunities to do so when I was booking my flight. 

I told the agent that I’m blessing the airline with my presence, and despite paying less money for the flight at Mach .8 than an Uber from NYC to Jersey that my carry on should be free. Fine, I pay the carry on fee.

I get on the flight, and wtf is this? I paid $58 dollars, why is this not like my G5?? My G5 has couches to lounge about. I have my own personal flight attendant. This airline SUCKS.

Then, a tornado is rolling through the surrounding area and the pilot tells us the flight is CANCELLED. WTF!? What kind of bullshit airline is this?

I’ve flown my G5 through so many tornadoes. Believe me, only crappy pilots can’t fly through tornadoes.

Never flying this airline again. Only flying my G5 from now on. ",Material-Sell-3666,23,57,frontierairlines
1ewcxao,2024-08-20 04:56:00,Our plane 'almost tipped over' after landing,"Last night, I had the most unique unboarding off of a plane I have ever experienced and wanted to share in case anyone else experiences something similar flying Frontier in the future (or was on the same flight and wanted to commiserate). Our flight from MSP to Denver was uneventful and normal outside of a short delay before boarding, but the ending made it memorable. (TLDR- our plane was too heavy in back and almost tipped over when we were disembarking)


We landed and people were getting out of their seats into the aisle, grabbing bags, etc. when all of a sudden, a mildly frazzled sounding flight attendant made an announcement over the intercom, ""Passengers, please move as quickly as possible to the front of the plane. We have too much weight in the back of the plane and are tipping over."" I was seated near the back and we were all confused about the directions as we were unable to move forward due to aisle gridlock and the people in front weren't moving forward or being let off the plane. 


A few minutes pass and the flight attendant, now fully frazzled, repeats the same instructions with greater urgency and explained that the gap to the ramp was too large to be crossed. For safety reasons we couldn't be let off the plane, but we also were still unbalanced because everyone in back was stuck there, lifting the nose into the air. Meanwhile, the flight attendant's announcements were getting increasingly frustrated as no one was moving. ""Passengers, please move as quickly as possible to the front of the plane to help bring the nose down. We are tipping over!!!"" ""Please cooperate as quickly as possible, we do not want the plane to tip over."" 


What had originally started as what some of us thought was a bad joke was getting increasingly tense as after a delay, the flight, and sitting on the runway, the night was getting long and it was now after 1am local time. Finally, they had people sit/cram into the seats in front and were able to get people moving down the aisle. They let us off in groups of 10 &amp; hustled us off with a quickness to do an outdoor unloading of the plane. Several of us had been forced to leave our carryon bags in the overhead compartments, so while I was waiting, I got to hear what happened.


Allegedly, the pilot had parked the plane, didn't bother to check if it was lined up or engaged the way it needed to be, and hopped off himself, leaving the flight crew to figure out how to connect the door to the ramp. (ETA-some people are messaging me saying this isn't the pilot's fault. I honestly don't know enough about plane mechanics or deplaning procedures to know who is most to blame, I am just repeating what I heard from the ground crew.) Other passengers I talked to who were in front confirmed they saw him leave and were confused that he was the first off. Ultimately all's well that ends well and we were all able to deplane and get our stuff, but I have never in almost 40 years of flying have heard the plane was tipping over. 


Shout out to the flight crew who did a fantastic job problem solving and getting us off the plane. I am sure they had to deal with more than their fair share of disgruntled passengers about the situation but it was clear they were doing what they could to figure it out. I do not, however, think I will be choosing Frontier again in the future.

1etfi2c,2024-08-16 12:08:35,Frontier Airlines Agent Told Me My Flight Was Cancelled But They Are Refusing To Reimburse Me.,"I had a flight with FlyFrontier on the 6th of August from LGA to CVG, which was cancelled due to the weather. My flight was then rebooked to the 8th. When I got to my gate for boarding, I saw some commotions, I asked a lady if she knew what was going but she wasn’t sure. We approached the Frontier Employee gate agent together, the agent told us that she has received an email stating that the flight is cancelled and we must go upstairs to ticket counter 8 to make alternative arrangements. 

I went upstairs, and about an hour to departure, I was still seeing that my flight does not say cancelled on the screens. I showed the Frontier employee my itinerary and asked if she’s sure this flight is cancelled. This lady said yes. They handed me a paper with a QR code where I can request a refund as opposed to waiting on the line. So I went home. I made a request through their online portal yesterday, yet FrontierCare is insisting that the flight left, therefore, I’m not entitled to a refund. At this point, I don’t even know what to believe. If the flight truly left —which is unbelievable, because me and several people left the gate when we were told the flight was cancelled to inquire of a refund — then I missed out on the chance to board because of their own error. However, if it did leave, why did these frontier agents tell us the flight was cancelled?

Quite frankly, my biggest mistake was flying with Frontier, as a frequent flyer, I’ve never had such issues with other airlines. I’m honestly in disbelief. also would like to note that I did not immediately leave the gate when I was told it was cancelled. I asked for reassurance that it was cancelled, for I still had not received any email that my flight was cancelled.",Significant-Yam2489,56,235,frontierairlines

18t3ry1,2023-12-29 04:33:46,BEWARE OF FRONTIER AIRLINES,"BUYERS BEWARE. We flew Frontier on 12/25 direct from Phoenix to Denver only to discover our bag for some reason did not make it. Since then, we’ve repeatedly been lied to and there is a huge lack of customer service of any kind.

On 12/25 we filed a lost bag claim and were told they’d have an update in 24 hours, fast forward 24 hours, no update. 

On 12/26 we drive to the airport and talk to the baggage service desk person (because they don’t answer the phone # they gave us that calls their desk directly). We’re told our bag actually HAS been located - it was sent to Houston for some reason but it will be on a direct flight to Denver this evening and we’ll get a call in the morning to schedule delivery.

12/27 comes and no update. At 12pm and 9pm I try calling their office, no answer. They don’t use their phones apparently so I start using their chat feature, of course it’s a robot and takes forever to get connected to a person only for them to tell me the bag has never been located and they’re not sure where it is. I get a call at 10pm that my bag IS still in Houston but they promise it will be on the flight tonight and should be delivered early in the morning on the 28th.

It’s now 2pm on the 28th. No update and still not answering their phones and their chat feature rarely works.

I will NEVER EVER fly this airline again even though I’ve actually been a fan for years. It comes off as a huge scam given all their customer service phone numbers lead to nowhere.

UPDATE: drove to airport and service desk agent claimed to be livid the day person won’t answer the office phone when I call to request an update. Calls Houston airport and puts on speaker as she talks to them - no idea where bag is now. She told me she’d call me with an update when the most recent flight from Houston landed at 10:30pm this evening. Guess who never called? LOL

UPDATE #2: Houston supposedly sent bag to Denver, Denver said it’s nowhere to be found. Officially declaring the bag lost and told me they will contact me Wednesday of next week to collect my claim and receipts. 🥲 Now the fun part of going to family and asking for receipts on all the nice Christmas gifts they just bought us for the claim.",Random_witchywoo,101,110,frontierairlines

I’ve always been pro-spirit / frontier for simple one-way domestic flights. Yes there’s issues here and there but if u are traveling light it’s a great value.

Had a flight delayed, boarded and deplaned twice, until the pilot says we aren’t leaving because he is going to “timeout”. This whole ordeal lasted 4-5 hours and by the time it was over it was 1am and the airport was empty. Had to pay for hotel and frontier emailed me with a voucher code for $100 (base fare only not including taxes and fees ). I was cool with this.

Welp, go to use the voucher and see what so many have complained about. $30 flight amounts to like $2 in base fare and $28 in taxes and fees. A $180 flight amounts to $90 in base fare and another $90 in fees. Absolutely diabolical. 

It’s time to move on. I really wanted to make use of this one time voucher and call it quits after that but I refuse to give these clowns one more cent of my money. To use that full $100 I would end up paying 10x that in fees. As hard as it is to do, I decided to eat the cost and sever my relationship forever.

I had read some suggestions on this sub to make sure you pay extra to pick seats, which I did. People started getting excited at the gate as one by one people noticed their seat assignment in the app change to ‘0’. I thought I was in the clear until I went to board and the scanner turned red, and I was told I didn’t have a seat. They had oversold the flight by 45 seats. 

I thought I was prepared with the new regulations around compensation if you are involuntarily bumped. I spoke with the gate agents (recorded conversation), they agreed we should get 4x the fare in compensation, and that it should be in cash or check, not voucher.

One of the attendants called a supervisor and the supervisor instructed her to give only $250 vouchers, nothing more. I was livid, and thought I would be able to file a complaint with the DOT or something. However it turns out that there is a loophole if they decide to send a smaller plane than originally booked.

I got to the airport at noon on wednesday and i finally left at 3:30 on thursday. they delayed my first flight 6 times until cancelling it and i booked a new one for later that night. well that one was delayed twice and then finally we were ON THE BRIDGE TO THE PLANE AND THEY TURNED US AROUND AT MIDNIGHT. So now there is an entire planes worth of people at the charlotte airport with nowhere to go. i have read that bigger airlines will pay for a hotel room and a shuttle if they have to cancel your flight, but Frontier? leave it to the worst airline in the country to even screw that up. we got a $5 FOOD VOUCHER. yes you read that correctly, for leaving us stranded at the airport at 12:30 at night they gave us a $5 voucher, that can’t even buy you a water bottle at an airport. 

so now the flight is for 11am the next morning. luckily my best friends mother lived close to the airport and i had a room, but those other poor people had to scramble to find a hotel and a ride to the hotel or just had to sleep at the airport. so i arrive at the airport at 10am the next morning, because when i wake up it was already delayed. now this is where the worst confusion happened, from about 10:45-12:45 nobody had a clue what flight was leaving next. the WORKERS WERE ASKING US WHAT FLIGHT WAS NEXT. the most incompetent horrible staff i’ve ever seen. so we are now delayed again, and now we have to move across the terminal over to a new gate, then we sit there for another 2 hours and FINALLY we get on the plane and go home. so from wednesday at noon until thursday at 3:30 i spent 19 hours at the airport waiting for frontier to put me on a 1 hour flight back home. 

so if you were ever on the fence about whether to use frontier because it’s cheaper, PLEASE NEVER USE FRONTIER. please pay the extra money and get something else unless you wanna be at the airport for 19 hours waiting for an awful confused staff to figure stuff out.

They also will get penalized if they don't do this. The trouble is, the time allowed for plane turnovers hasn't increased, so they can't start boarding any earlier and they have less time to board.

However, the agent stopped boarding and let us know that the flight had to leave early due to wind conditions at the arrival airport (I have audio and video recordings of him saying that). Had to stay at a hotel for a day. We were late to the destination by 22 hours. I understand that there is a slim possibility of getting any reimbursement. Has anyone faced this issue? Did you get any money from them or the credit card travel insurance (I used Saphire preferred)? 


UPDATE: 
1. I filed a complain to Frontier. They acknowledged their early departure and provided a $100 travel voucher for me. My spouse will file similar complain tomorrow and hopefully we will get $100 more. We will be even on the additional cost. 

2. I received a written confirmation of the flight delay due to weather issue from Frontier. Chase told me earlier that with such a written confirmation, I am eligible to claim all the expenses. Hopefully, I will be getting ~200/300$ more. If they refuse, no issue in my end.

3. We took full advantage of the additional day and explored the downtown.

1edwbe6,2024-07-28 09:44:17,Thinking of taking Frontier to small claims court,"A few months ago, I agreed (stupidly) to voluntarily off board a flight for a $1000 voucher.

The voucher t&amp;c as listed in Frontier’s first email to me include:
* voucher can be used for airfare and fees, including baggage
* can be used to purchase tickets for others as long as I am traveling in the same party
* single use. Remaining value will be forfeited.
* valid for a year

Seemed like fine conditions to me … until I tried to book a trip a few days later.

What followed was the biggest shit-show ever. 

For starters, they changed their t&amp;c (apparently now they decided the voucher can only be used by me, and only for base airfare). When I called them out on sending me wildly different t&amp;c, they acted like it was no big deal. 

I was pretty salty about it all, but I booked my trip through chat anyway - the total cost for which was about half the voucher value.

Since I had made a huge stink about the change in t&amp;c, they offered me another voucher for the remaining value. 

“Okay, maybe they’re not that bad,” I thought. 

I was wrong.

They booked my requested three-legged flight as single flight with a 72-hour  layover … and had no answer to how I would get my checked luggage for the 72-hours I was at my second destination. 

I asked them to just cancel the booking their agents fucked up, and that I would book another trip at a later time.

They refused to cancel my booking. In fact, they told me that the second voucher they had issued me had also been used by me (which I clearly hadn’t because I was still at home trying to figure out how to use my first voucher ) so I have no more credit with them and that “this case is now closed”.

I have all of this documented on email. The wildly different t&amp;c, the messing up of my booking, the absolute lie that I had used the second voucher. 

I have a lot of time on my hands and I am wondering if I should take Frontier to small claims court. Anyone try to do that yet?

I did not travel on any of their flights, nor talk to any of their employees (because all flights were cancelled or rescheduled into oblivion, and there were no employees in sight at any airport I was at). So they key to flying Frontier is to not take their flights nor interact with their personnel.

The refund form was at [https://frontiercswprod.powerappsportals.com/contact-us/request-refund/](https://frontiercswprod.powerappsportals.com/contact-us/request-refund/) and it all went quite smoothly. 

----------------

Months ago, I booked a frontier flight from San Antonio to Philadelphia via Orlando. I had a confirmation number, and Frontier's app and website both showed me details for my confirmed flights. I kept checking back to see if anything was changing, and nothing did.

This was actually the return part of my original booking - they messed around with the outbound flight (changing a 2 hour stop to a 23 hour one!) so I took the credit so-called refund, and got another airline instead. The return flights were still listed and there was a reservation with my name that came up just as you'd expect with any normal airline.

The night before, I tried to check in on the app. It happily showed me all the flight details, but It told me I didn't have seats assigned so had to see an agent - after reading some stuff on here, I was not surprised at this. So I tried on the website instead, where it took me through some dark patterns (do you want a bundle? - No - Oh come on, take a bundle please? NO!) and eventually it did give me a button to complete check in. Hooray! Oh wait. Flight not open for checkin. Hmm. So I looked again the next morning, at the airport, and got the same message.

It's now 2.5 hours before the flight should leave. You will probably be able to guess how many Frontier staff were at the desk ready to help me check in. (Hint - none at all)

I thought, ok Frontier you win, I will pay for seats. I went on the app and went to my flight details - everything was shown as the same times+places, with my name etc for two seats. I went through and selected seats for both flights - noticing that *all seats* were available for purchase. It wouldn't let me buy those seats either, giving me the same message that the flights were 'not open for checkin'.

Eventually someone from the neighbouring desk helped me. They called Frontier and learned that my flights had been cancelled for months!!! I was expecting a tricky experience with these people but this was even worse than I thought. Even if the flight is cancelled, surely they have to actually tell you about it?! The flight even shows up for me when I look at it now, a week after it was supposed to have flown!

They say you get what you pay for. Turns out with Frontier, you don't even get that.

Anyway, I know all this is quite in character for Frontier. I was almost looking forward to flying with them - their nasty cheats on baggage charges, the dark patterns in their website, or paying just to talk to somebody.. It seemed sort of like an airline Fawlty Towers and was ready to laugh at the stupidity of it all. But sadly no.

I'm wondering what course of action I should take - they've stolen the money I paid them and cost me a bunch more to get home a different way. Please don't tell me to try calling them, I know they won't answer. Maybe an email, but I will never expect any reply. It seems wrong to just ignore it and write it off without even doing anything.

Orland to Chicago Midway leaving at 550 pm was delayed 4-5 times as we observed flights arrive, pull up to out terminal and leave to the other side for flights to alt destinations. Our 550pm departure became 701, then 730, then 801, then 830pm. 

The most frustrating part is how the supervisor who relieved the young lady that stood there answering, as best she could, our redundant questions about leaving or updates. The supervisor looked me dead in the eye and said , “yeah , I announced last call to board.” Some of us had gone to the eatery about 50 feet away and heard nothing. Each of us monitored updates online but received conflicting information @ emails and Frontiers app. A few passengers even got messages about the flight departing the next day at various times.

We barely made it on the flight. Arrived at Chicago beat up and battered near midnight after LITERALLY spending allllll day at Orlando Airport in hopes we could leave as scheduled. 

Repetitive coddling with lies of maintaining or disinfecting every plane we watched pull into our terminal and leave to catch up to other delayed flights is an assbackwards way of making a profit and sustaining credibility with patrons. Imagine what shareholders would say about this at the next annual meeting?

 The sad part is the plane was only 50% filled! I thought fuel costs were inflated due to shipping containers being diverted around the Suez Canal? Lots of frustrated customers who deserved to get home to loved ones should not have had to endure this. Why lie to us and still look stupid.

1fepw4g,2024-09-12 08:42:13,I don't get it...,"Had four flights in the last week (going to destination with a layover in Denver, same coming back home) and I just don't get all the hate. Didn't have a single issue that everyone constantly complains about, especially with the layovers. 

Sat in third row each time, so the extra leg room definitely made a difference in comfortability, but like...flying is uncomfortable. Every single airline I've rode with was uncomfortable. However, I spent less money and had more comfort in choosing a good seat with Frontier, and spent more money with a random seat and was way more uncomfortable on United and Southwest.

Charging for snacks was a non-issue, as I was smart enough to pack my own. I do this regardless of the airline charging, as I want what I want. Seems easy enough.

Every single gate agent and flight attendant was pleasant, helpful, and professional. Don't be a rude idiot, and you'll find that people are more inclined to be nice to you... 

My layovers were a few hours, which I thought would suck, but Denver is HUGE, and I was in no rush, so time flew by. It was nice to break up the flight time, stretch my legs, grab some food and drinks, and not have to run to my gate. 

All four of my flights left on time and arrived early. Nothing else to say about that, except that it was a very pleasant surprise.

I'm sure a lot of the complaints here are valid, but you are living in a fairy land if you think this stuff doesn't happen on every other airline.

I promptly received my ""Travel Guard Policy Confirmation,"" so I know that I entered the e-mail correctly.   Looking at my credit card bill, I saw they wasted no time processing the \~$400(US) charge - but sent no confirmation e-mail.

I tried using the online chat - but it's fully automated, and not capable of servicing a request like this.

I tried calling various numbers, which were answered - but weirdly disconnected after 30 seconds each of the six times I called.

I tried cancelling the ticket, but was unable to do so, because cancelling a ticket requires the confirmation code contained in the e-mail I never received.

Finally, I went to my credit card company, explained the situation, described my futile efforts to resolve the issue with Frontier Airlines.  My credit card company reimbursed the full amount, and said they would contest the matter themselves.

Got to the airport a little early. I dont purchase a seat so i take what i can get. It was a fairly full flight, however there was a man sitting by himself at the window a row in front of me (i was in aisle in a row of 3) so the FA asked if i wanted to move for more space, so i did. Flight went off without a hitch, actually arrived to the destination (BUF-&gt;MCO) 40 mins early so it was already a great start to my short vacation. Way home, same thing. No issues. Flight was full, for some reason the lady next to me (i was middle seat this time) left the flight for some reason (on her own) so i was able to move over and once again had more room. Again, no flight issues whatsoever. Arrived back home on time (not early this time though).

Has anyone else experienced this and know what's going on here? Is there actually another flight happening? Because checking their available flights or the status for this one shows no indication, neither did they know at the airport several hours before.

So a guy I was helping arrived at the airport Wednesday afternoon, was supposed to fly ATL-PHX Thursday night, overnight in PHX, 7:30 a.m. flight to the West Coast. Original flight delayed (mechanical) until Friday morning, so they rerouted him through DEN Friday night with Saturday evening flight to his destination. 

I went to the counter with him Friday evening to try to get him a meal voucher for his day in Denver, and the supervisor said his current itinerary wasn't delayed (!!), so he couldn't give him a voucher.

I said it would be because of the delay on the original flight. Supervisor said ""But that flight was yesterday."" I said ""Yes, it was scheduled for yesterday, but he wasn't rebooked until today"" (in the wee hours). Supervisor said he was a contractor, could lose his job, had no discretion. No voucher. 

Meanwhile, just the day before, a different guy had been delayed 4 hours to Miami and a $10 voucher came, unsolicited AFAIK, to the card used to buy the flight. The deal was ""use your card at a merchant listed as a restaurant and we'll reimburse you eventually."" That seemed pretty iffy to me and the voucher went unused, expired after 24 hours. (The guy got food another way.)

The gate agent then told us next available flight was two days later. Ok, but still worth it to me for $1000. One lady asked if the flight credit expires and gate agent said no it doesn't. sweet! 

I get home and discover the voucher does expire a year later (kind of expected that) but also that it has to all be used at once and only for a ticket for me (cant buy someone else a ticket with it). ""Available for one-time use, with no remaining value after redemption."" So basically it's more restrictive than flight credit on any other airline. Certainly more restrictive than vouchers for getting bumped on any other airline.

1cct716,2024-04-25 22:20:45,Frontier horror story,"Background this was for Frontier airlines flight from Orlando to Punta Cana on April 24, 2024.

Yesterday passengers were rejected at the gate because they did not have the physical version of their boarding pass (only mobile).  According to the gate crew they had an issue with their system being down where they would only accept the physical pass not the mobile version.  They made this announcement in the intercom a few minutes before boarding.  Right after the announcement there was a huge rush to the counter for people to print their boarding passes and E ticket (Dominican republic requires this). 

Instead of waiting for everyone to print their boarding passes they opted to close the gate on a bunch of people waiting in line who didn’t yet have a physical version.  It was one of them most rediculous things I’ve ever witnessed.  We saw multiple groups of friends on vacation who got split up which was awful to witness.  One was on the plane already quite frantic talking to her friend over the phone who was left at the gate and the gate crew shut the doors on her and would not reopen.  According to her they ripped her boarding pass apart and basically said take the next flight out tomorrow.  Others were left behind at the airport as well without any answers.  The pilot got involved and tried to get them to open gates but the gate crew refused.  The flight attendants were very nice but obviously had no authority in this situation to do much.  It’s so crazy because these were paying customers who were there on time and had done everything right just to be denied.  Not to mention all the fighting between the gate crew/pilot/flight attendants ended up wasting quite a bit of time.  The time it could have taken to just let the people on and print their passes and e ticket would have been the same.  They also had to physically remove the peoples checked bags which took more time then simply letting them on.  

I don’t necessarily know who’s at fault whether it’s frontier or the 3rd party gate agents Orlando airport hires to conduct business.  However, let this be a warning to always get your physical boarding pass and double check if you’re flying international to always make sure you have your customs papers ahead of time.  The airlines don’t care if you bought a ticket or inconvenienced you.

I had a confirmed flight and a boarding pass, when I scanned my barcode at the gate the agent cleared and error and waived me onto the flight.  When I went to my row, my seat (middle) was taken, so I waited a few moments in the aisle seat to check my ticket and confirm that the passenger was also in the correct seat (and she was). I triple checked all the information, and when the person came for the aisle seat I was temporarily stowed in, I flagged over the flight attendant. She had me stand in empty slot while the rest of boarding occurred, and eventually I was standing in the rear galley/restroom area with the other flight attendant.  The gate agent eventually was summoned, and I was led back to the podium. While she tapping keys another employee shut the boarding door and the gate, and plane pulled back from the gate.

After that, the gate agent who was helping me just doodled off. She said she'd be right back.. and just disappeared. She never came back, the gate was completely abandoned, and after like \~20 minutes, the arriving flight information appeared.

The flight wasn't expensive, but I'm still pretty annoyed. As far as I can tell, this is involuntarily denied boarding and the flight was oversold.

I haven't been able to get any Frontier agents to engage with me at all. I stopped at a ticket counter at Frontier in MSY and they told me to submit a refund request through the website, which I did, and I finally today (about 8 days later) got a denial of my refund request, but without any explanation.

1c80dfl,2024-04-19 23:56:16,Frontier flight got canceled had to change airports to board a different flight,"Recently I took my parents for vacation to Chicago from Atlanta, so we were initially supposed to board ORD to ATL using Frontier but when we arrived at the gate we were told that it was canceled and to go back to ticketing.

So we went back to the counter and were given options to request a full refund or reschedule flight. At that time the only other flights available on that day was spirit for like 300+ dollars, American Airlines for 600?? I think, it made most sense to book a different Frontier flight which was flying in like 2 hours. It would be even more ridiculous to book a flight the next day because we'd have to book a hotel etc.

But the thing is we had to take an uber from ORD to MDW which wasn't cheap - so I asked the ticketing counter if it will be covered and they said that they should if I explain the situation. Now I'm on the live chat with 3 agents so far no one said they can issue a refund or even exchange the vouchers for cash. My parents are visiting from overseas so no one's gonna actually use those measly 100 dollar vouchers they credited us for canceling the flight.

I know this is a stretch and not as terrible as some Frontier horror stories posted on here, but has anyone ever been in the same situation or managed to get a refund for Uber?

Then near 10, we get delayed to 12:15AM, immediately after delayed to 6AM (Monday, June 3rd).  I’ve seen this before, the delay is what it is. Got some drinks and buckled down to sleep in the airport.

Peacefully fall asleep and am awoken by a ton of commotion at 4AM. My flights been cancelled. Frontier rebooks me immediately on a flight leaving at 12PM to ORD, with a 3 hour layover and then to MCO. Sucks. I can still make it home. Had to call out of work.

I waited in the ticket line to talk to an agent with my flight. Fighting ensued in the line, people were cutting, screaming. I waited for probably almost 3 hours patiently. The couple in front of me grab the last seats on a plane headed to Jacksonville. I ask her for anything earlier to anywhere near MCO or even Atlanta, she says nothing else is leaving until tomorrow at 10PM. As in Tuesday, June 4th. She tells me I’m confirmed, I have a seat assignment. My 12PM flight is the best option. Great. I wait. 

They offer no hotels to people who weren’t leaving until Tuesday night, but not my business. 

Flights delayed an hour. We start boarding at 1PM. I have priority boarding, I scan my boarding pass in zone 1 and they tell me I have no seat, the flights been oversold and I’ve been removed from it. At this point I’m sobbing. I’m leaving for an international trip from Orlando Wednesday… and never imagined it would be this hard to get home. They CONFIRM that they just have to count seats and they will put me on the plane. They hold me and a gentleman. They NEVER ask if anybody is looking to voluntarily move to another flight. They also FLAT OUT tell me that they always pull the lowest paid ticket because 4x the lowest is better for them, regardless of booking, status, check-in, or other upgrades. As I wait, out comes a boy (maybe 18?) from the gate. They had boarded him, he’d gotten to the plane to find out he had no seat, and they had WALKED him off the plane. 

They told me I wasn’t going to get my 4x compensation. They offered me a flight to Cincinnati that leaves at 9PMish and landed at 1AM. I said, I’m trying to go to Orlando, and you rebooked me on this flight. I did end up receiving my payment (woo… $200…). I was done, and didn’t trust the flight would leave. Had they cancelled my flight earlier I would have bought another flight, but by the time they cancelled my flight everything was sold out.

The gate agents were incredibly rude. They told me I would get on the plane and it wasn’t full, to change their mind ten minutes later. She tried to argue with me regarding my compensation rights. The guy with me asked if they could send him on a flight to midway instead of o’hare, and she said No. Why not? You bumped him from the flight! 

I don’t understand why the 6AM delay didn’t take off to begin with. I’m still sitting in DFW rebooked on a full American Airlines flight that cost me $350 in a desperate attempt to get home.

1dlbdcn,2024-06-22 02:44:07,The GoWild package is a scam,"The GoWILD package is an ABSOLUTE SCAM!

You prepay $499 to get unlimited flights and next to no cost (with the exception of taxes and fees.) Sounds great right? WRONG!!! When the stewardess is on the PA soliciting this package to everyone, they conveniently neglect to tell you the following:

1. They DON'T tell you that you have to purchase your flight THE DAY BEFORE the flight takes off. The obvious problem here is that there is no guarantee that any seats will be available on the flight you want. Furthermore, since its within the 24 hours time period, you can't get a refund if you need to cancel.
2. They DON'T tell you that on each flight, there are a FINITE amount of seats allocated to GoWild pass holders. For example, there might be 50 available seats on a flight you can purchase, but only 3 of those 50 are exclusively for GoWild members. If 3 GoWild pass holders buy those seats before you do, you're out of luck on getting a seat using your GoWild package despite there still being 47 other seats still available!
3. Building off of point #2, they DON'T tell you how many GoWild seats are available per flight. It could be 3 seats...or 1... or with their shady ass tactics, it could be 0!! They don't have to disclose this apparently. I have written confirmation of this from their sh\*tty overseas outsourced support.
4. They DONT tell you that if those seats are supposedly booked, you simply can't use your GoWild Pass. The GoWild tab on the web/mobile app will be grayed out. If you search google for GoWild problems, you will find countless forums of people complaining about how they can never use their GoWild package.
5. If you are unsuccessful in being able to purchase a flight, do NOT expect to be able to receive any support with a live person over the phone. Their automated screening essentially dead-ends anyone trying to get through to support that doesn't have an active flight already purchased. Instead, you get to use an online/mobile chat app with some unsympathetic overseas agent that will more often than not, simply abandon the conversation when they don't feel like dealing with the issue at hand!
6. Haven't been able to use your GoWild package and want a refund? Good luck with that. They tell you to request your refund from the following page [https://frontiercswprod.powerappsportals.com/.../request.../](https://frontiercswprod.powerappsportals.com/.../request.../)

If you go there, you get a drop down menu in which you have to select the Refund category. There's nothing there for the GoWild package. Again, you get Dead-ended.

Summary:

I purchased the package for $499, have never been able to successfully use it. Save your money, don't buy this scam GoWild Package. The probability of it working for you is very slim. You will NOT be able to get through to support and the likelihood of you being able to get a refund is next to nil.

1fde4ie,2024-09-10 17:57:05,Flight diversion and 10+ hours of delay...all for an hour flight ,"I don't even know how to sum up what just happened concisely...but first and foremost I want to give major props to the crew and pilot in this situation. An EXTREMELY scary and stressful issue was handled in a calm and collected manner which helped the passengers feel more at ease during what can only be described as pure chaos so thank you! 🙏

Today I was flying from SNA to SFO (usually a 1 hour flight), and was delayed 4+ hours due to mechanical issues with the arriving plane. This was quite annoying but what can you do? We received a meal voucher and eventually boarded our plane and headed for SFO.

10 minutes into the very short flight, a man sitting in a window seat in the middle of the plane had what seemed to be an extreme psychotic episode and pulled down all of the oxygen masks in his row, proceeded to reach into the mechanical area above the seats, and attempted to jump over the two other seats into the aisle. At this point others around him were absolutely freaking out, and some brave passengers quickly sprang into action to physically restrain him, while the flight attendants rushed over to attempt to mitigate the situation. After a full 5 minutes of struggle (headlocks and all), the man was held on the ground in the back of the plane laying down. We then diverted to Ontario, CA where the saucer-eyed man was escorted off the plane by police, calling every woman he passed a ""fat bitch"" as he walked off. Wtf?

At this point the crew and pilots were legally not able to fly anymore and the plane was out of commission due to the damage the man caused, so Frontier needed to fly in an entirely new crew which took about 6 hours. Nothing we could do about this either, just a long delay on top of a long delay and a traumatizing experience. 

Just wanted to share this wild experience and thank the crew, pilots, and fellow passengers for making a horrifying time a little less scary. 💛",sweetheartburger,14,51,frontierairlines
1g4sbqg,2024-10-16 13:42:10,I’ve stopped rolling the dice,"I’ve only flown Frontier twice, and this past experience with a trip taken over the weekend is hands down the most insane flight experience I’ve had. Flew from SFO to OKC with a brief layover in Denver in between. The layover ended up being an hour longer, but I wasn’t too shocked about it. The entire trip took 6 hours. Getting back home from OKC to SFO (same layover in Denver) was the problem. It took 16 hours. My flight out of OKC was delayed 1 hour which meant I had 6 minutes to sprint to the connecting flight in Denver to SFO. The plane actually landed at a reasonable time window for me to make it to the connecting flight, but we ended up being stuck on the tarmac for half an hour. As soon as the door opened, I sprinted down 40 gates and missed the door by minutes. A few more people that came from my same flight trickled in after, and we were in absolute defeat. Apparently 15 people were missing in that flight. It was 10pm and the next flight to SFO was 11am the following day. 

I knew booking budget airlines meant managing your expectations to be very low, but I never would have imagined being in a situation where I had to stay in a nearby hotel due schedule changes that are completely out of control. Denver has a customer service desk, but there was only one person working. Getting my flight rescheduled and receiving accommodations took 1.5hours and I didn’t arrive to the hotel until 1:30am. 

If you’re traveling for an event/special occasion, I highly recommend avoiding budget airlines like Frontier because you could very likely miss it. I can’t imagine navigating this experience if you’re traveling with children/elders, have low stamina, health risks, or do not understand English to get help. 

As for me, I’m no longer rolling the dice. I’ll pay extra on an airline that has their standards straight. 

One last thing; Frontier doesn’t add up to be that much cheaper. My flight was $200 but they charge $140 if you need to bring a carry on. You could pay $400 for a reliable airline that doesn’t charge for every little thing. ",krackncheese,25,38,frontierairlines
1fg5vql,2024-09-14 05:21:57,I Feared Frontier Would Have Me Arrested for Their Mistake and Violation of FAA Regulations,"I (40,f) was flying Frontier from Philadelphia to Orlando to visit my sister who had recently had a baby. I checked in for the flight and received my boarding pass the day before the trip. I arrived at the airport and boarded my flight when my group was called. I sat in my seat and struck up a conversation with a nice lady beside me and told her how excited I was to visit my sister and new niece. When the boarding was nearly complete, a gate agent boarded the plane, approached me, and asked to see my boarding pass. Upon producing the boarding pass, the gate agent said I was not on the manifest and accused me of sneaking onto the plane. I later learned that my seat had somehow been given to a passenger waiting to fly standby. The agent then said that I needed to leave the plane. When I questioned this, she stated that I would be forced off the plane if I did not comply. This is a violation of FAA regulations. As stated on the US Department of Transportation website:

**Once a passenger has been accepted for boarding or has already boarded the flight, airlines are not permitted  to require that passenger deplane, unless the removal of the passenger is required by safety, security, or health reasons, or the removal is due to the passenger’s unlawful behavior.**

The FAA realizes that involuntarily removing passengers from flights is not conducive to operating a safe flight, and therefore prohibits it. It appears that this employee was not trained on this regulation. At that point, I reasonably believed this gate agent would have me arrested, so I left the plane. **To reiterate -** **a Frontier employee escalated a situation while directly violating FAA regulations, and I diffused it****.** After deplaning and returning to the terminal, the other gate agent realized the seriousness of what the first agent had done and said I needed to get back on the plane. She radioed the first agent to hold the flight and led me back down the bridge. I was in tears as the agents argued amongst themselves and with the standby passenger, holding up the departure of the flight. After a few minutes, the friendly lady I was sitting by emerged from the plane and told me to enjoy my time with my sister. I tearfully walked back to her seat while all the other passengers watched.

The correct action in the situation of an overbooked flight as required by the Department of Transportation is also given on their website:

**Before an airline forces a passenger to give up his/her seat due to overbooking, the airline must ask passengers on the flight if they are willing to give up their seat voluntarily in exchange for compensation.**

I realize Frontier is a discount airline and saves money by doing things such as not offering free soft drinks and charging for carry-on baggage. However, from this event, it appears that Frontier is also attempting to save money by ignoring FAA requirements for overbooked flights and not properly training their gate agents to offer compensation. Safety is not something on which to save money. Since 2020, there has been an increase of passenger misbehaviors on flights including verbal abuse of flight crew. Airlines including Frontier have correctly called out this risk to safety and called for increased enforcement and penalties in such situations. Indeed, if I had violated FAA regulations, I could have faced tens of thousands of dollars in fines and possible prison time. This begs the question: If Frontier wants passengers to obey FAA regulations and be appropriately held responsible when they don’t, what is Frontier’s position when their employees violate FAA regulations?

To date I have been offered 10,000 miles on Frontier for this ordeal, which amounts to approximately a mere $20 off a future flight. To my knowledge, they did not compensate the lady who left the plane so that I could reboard. Frontier referred to the situation as a “lack of professionalism.” These actions indicate that Frontier does not take this matter seriously. Following FAA regulations is a serious matter for both passengers and airlines. Passengers should not fear being arrested due to Frontier's violation of FAA regulations in an attempt to save money.

Wait 3 hours, get to front at 8:30 when they tell me I missed the flight and there's no refunds. I laughed, she said ""ok I'll put in a refund request."".. She never did. 

Now been chatting with customer 'service' for 3 hours and was told this: ""thanks for the wait, sorry for the delay, we have reviewed your flight and based on the information on this plus the one you have given us your flight does not apply for refund for the following reasons it is marked as no show there is no information that there were no agents at the airport tik tok is not sufficient evidence therefore we cannot refund your flight.  We are sorry, but we cannot work with bookings already in no show status. ""

So far it looks like airlines will get away with this until massive lawsuits happen.

Edit 12/23: Chase saphire never accepted the charge back no matter how much I tried. I got a ""flight voucher"" for half the cost which I unsurprisingly find out is another scam. The flight voucher is good for the 'base airfare"" and can only be used one time. What they don't tell you is 80% of the cost of the ticket are fees and other garbage.

I exclusively fly frontier (even before the GoWild pass, I almost exclusively used it because they are insanely affordable for the routes I frequent). Bought the 6 month GoWild pass a while back and have used it 15 times, saving me a bunch (yes, I’ve done the math 😂). Only say that to show I’ve seen how they’ve handled boarding over the last six years. 

I’m pretty vocal on this sub that people don’t be stupid with “personal items”. 99% of the time, it’s your fault if you get charged. Saw a few on a three-segment route I had today 🫡

In any case, they backed off forcing everyone to physically size bags almost entirely around the time the lawsuit was filed. But on my last six flights, including every leg of the three-segment route I had today, it is back in full force.

I have my bag to a science nowadays, so it always fits, but I say this just as a word of caution: I suspect that the bonus has been reinstated, incentivizing the full use of bag sizers at the gate again. *Don’t be dumb, pack smart, and make sure you bring a bag that actually fits in the sizer, metal water bottles and blankets included 😂*",Eagles365or366,61,78,frontierairlines

1bcyke9,2024-03-12 22:28:06,For those considering flying Frontier,"This sub is clogged with all sorts of reports of flying drama with Frontier.  You might deduce that flying Frontier is a really bad idea.  I just wanted to come on here and say that lots of flights by Frontier leave on time, arrive on time, and passengers on those flights got good value for their money.  They are not inclined to come on here and say ""I had a great flight on Frontier!""    My sister in-law lives in Denver, we live in Tampa, and she visits us all the time as she snags cheap flights here.   Hers is the optimal situation for using Frontier, it really doesn't matter to her or us when Frontier drastically changes the flight times, if her flight is delayed, or if her flight is canceled.  She just lets us know accordingly and we pick her up when her flight eventually gets here.   

If you are considering Frontier, you have to ask yourself if you are prepared if things don't go as planned.   Do you have set plans, time-wise to where you are going?  What if your flight is delayed hours (or days)?  Same on the return, what if the flight is delayed or canceled?  Does this really matter to you?  Frontier, like most of the budget carriers, doesn't have alternate routings or backup planes if things go south, compared to the major airlines.  They have very little customer support to help you if things go wrong.  This is the trade-off you must weigh. 

There are some things you should never do.  If you are planning to connect to another airline somewhere, or fly to connect to a cruise, etc, just don't fly Frontier!  They often change schedules, and as I mentioned above, there isn't any backup plan if things go south.   At the very least, leave yourself a day's connection if you can.  Same thing applies to foreign destinations during high season.  (like Cancun)  Be mentally prepared to stay an extra day or two in the airport on the way back, or prepared to rebook on another carrier.  If this turns you off, then just don't fly Frontier!

The other thing to mention is that flying the major airlines might not be an advantage at certain times of the year, when things go south, especially at certain times of the year or to certain destinations (like to/from Florida at Spring Break)  If your flight to Florida on United or American doesn't go, it might be a day or two for them to get you there during spring break, because every flight is full.

This first issue was a delay....which whatever...fine.

After this delay, they changed the gate. I normally am first in line, but the gate change threw me off.

When I finally went to board, there was a line of about 10-15 people, and I noticed it wasn't moving at all. After a while, the pilot came out and spoke with the group. From my understanding, the plane needed more fuel than normal because the plane had to take a longer route to avoid poor weather.

Unfortunately, the 10-15 people left were too heavy for the plane to accommodate us, and we were denied boarding.

I blame myself for trusting Frontier to get me to San Francisco on time, but not shockingly, the next available flight through Frontier was 2 days later. I really needed to be in San Francisco as soon as possible, so I immediately let Delta fuck me with no Vaseline for a one way fare of 600+ dollars.

I understand that these things happen, but where I'm really upset is with the customer service.

The gate agents were nice enough, but they seemed to have no idea what was going on. When they officially told us we would not be boarding, the whole situation became chaotic.

 Frontier shares a gate with Alaska, so we had to go to a different gate to try to rebook or request a refund. There were a handful of unhappy people in front of me, and I didn't want to miss the Delta flight, so I left in order to catch my flight on time.

I would have preferred to deal with the issue in person, but I ended up telling myself I'd just ask for a refund through customer service.

The customer service online is awful. There is a huge language barrier with the people they've hired. When I finally got someone who really understood what had happened to me, they pretty much claimed it didn't happen. 

I fly Frontier quite a bit, so much that I have Gold Status. But I'm not sure I'm going to use them as much anymore. I'm incredibly frustrated. I think I might just dispute the flight with my credit card company.

My wife used the bathroom near the area the gas the leaking and she ended up throwing up 3 times.  You could see the panic from the Flight attendants.  

We had to divert to Vegas and do an emergency landing.  Everyone was herded out the two FAs were taken out by the EMT and my wife was left behind with no medical care given to her.  She just went to the bathroom at the airport and threw up a few more times there.  This was around 7pm after experiencing 2 delays.  We had to get a new plane and the next one was at 6am in the mornong. 

They promised us hotel vouchers and flight vouchers as an apology.  It took several hours for our flights to be rescheduled and we were told to wait for the hotel vouchers in the email.  So we ended up just sitting on the floor with my wife and 3 kids because it was packed with people trying to find a place to sit down.  The hotel vouchers never came.  My kids were exhausted at this point so I just took an Uber and luckily had a friend in Vegas who was able to let us wait at their house at around midnight. 

We came back the next day they ended up just giving us a 75 dollar food voucher instead of covering hotels(such a slap to thr face after promising us hotel vouchers).  The hotel costs were around 500 to 600 dollars so the airline just left people hanging.  Some people found a way to drive to San diego and most of them had to sleep on the ground at the airport.

My flight was supposed to leave at 11:05 pm but got delayed an hour and a half because the plane was stuck in Dlorida for some reason and had to fly to phoenix before coming to Chicago. Anyway, we had no problem boarding. Except for when the pilot came over the PA and stated that because of a 10 day maintenance thing we had to leave at the top of the hour or we can’t leave at all. They do the safety demo and we start driving to the runway. I was very relieved because i had to be in Phoenix by 8:00 am MST. We get onto the runway. That’s when the Pilot came over the PA and told us the company just texted him and said we had to go back to the gate and we couldn’t fly. I was stuck in Chicago as an 18 y/o. After 3 hours on the phone with my father we finally booked a United Airline flight and I got into Phoenix at 9:34. I will never in my life try to fly with Frontier ever again. P.S I was at the airport at 10am and had to sit there for over 12 hours because as stated i was with the choir and got dropped off when they left to go back to MN. The only thing Frontier offered was a full refund. No hotel, nothing.",Mean-Consequence9188,30,67,frontierairlines

1ae0maz,2024-01-30 01:19:35,Delayed flight causing me to cancel whole flight,"Frontier Airlines does it again! I had a connecting flight to Pheonix from Houston with the final destination being Nashville. (Dont understand why there isnt a direct flight since its only 2h by flying away). 

3 hours before my flight got a notification that my flight is delayed by 2h. Guess what? That will make me miss my connecting flight. 

Ended up canceling my trip. I only booked with them because I had a $100 voucher from a previously delayed flight (by 4 hours at that).

Never flying Frontier again.",DrowningInSwag,48,112,frontierairlines
1akrx7c,2024-02-07 10:20:40,"Frontier changed planes, moved me from exit row, and gas lighted me about it","I’m a pretty meticulous person. Not someone who can choose an airline seat and 60 seconds. I will usually check two or three seat guru type webs webs websites before making a decision if the flights gonna be over three hours.  This one was. 
I finally decided on 29F. It was a window, the seat actually reclined, and there was no seat immediately in front of me. I remember debating about having to walk forward to put my stuff under the seat. I chose the seat and the app armed me that I was sitting in an exit row. I agreed. 
I remember the seat map showed that the last row of the plane had only two seats in it. 

Fast forward to one hour before flight time and I checked the app just to make sure everything was on time and noticed that I was no longer sitting in an exit row, but I was still sitting in 29F. The plane also had 3 seats in the last row of the plane. 

I started a chat  with the agent (you can’t call). I told him the seat map had changed. He said I was always in 29F and Frontier had changed nothing. He was really arrogant and told me he’d do a “one time” change for me but he would “ fully document the record” and hate whatever that means. So he basically acts like he’s doing me a favor to get me back into an exit seat, but it is inferior to my original seat.

I hate this airline.",forkful_04_webbed,35,89,frontierairlines

1be60m1,2024-03-14 07:14:08,"Lost our paid assigned seats, only offer voucher as a refund.","We don’t fly. It’s our very first flight and we paid for the middle and window seat because we were super excited to see the sky. We got onto the plane and they said they had to accommodate someone with a wheelchair and we lost both our seats, but offered us a refund and free snacks. Like okay sure.

Going to customer service after arriving, they only are offering a voucher. Like, it’s been 24 years since a flight (my birth) and I’m definitely not flying again. I told them this but they are very strict as this is the only thing they offer. WTH? I’m not even gonna use it…

Idk I’m so dumb with this, who would I contact to actually get a refund- I feel like life been scammed ",oxenqueen,93,649,frontierairlines
19en3tg,2024-01-25 02:18:24,Frontier refusing to consider bag “lost” and it’s been over 30 days?,"Anyone dealt with frontier losing a bag on a non-stop flight? They located our bag in Houston the day it was lost but then lost it again. It’s now been 32 days since that happened but they’re refusing to consider the bag lost and mail us a reimbursement check. At this point we’ve replaced everything in the bag and the DOT website says an airline is subject to enforcement action if they refuse to consider a bag lost after it’s been missing for an “unreasonable period of time”. It also states most airlines consider a bag lost after 5-14 days…

Any suggestions on communicating with them?",Random_witchywoo,15,265,frontierairlines

Well, the line to check in our bags must of been a mile long, no joke, I’d guess about 300 people in front of us. We FINALLY get to the coo, scan boarding pass, was told we wouldn’t make it, had to go to additional services. Long line too, she scans boarding pass, gives us options. Make long story short, we wind up purchasing 2 more tickets while in line, make flight. Get home, husband is checking email to find an email from Frontier saying flight was delayed. Why weren’t we informed when we were checking in bags that our flight was delayed??? Twice they scanned our boarding passes and don’t tell us. Maybe beyond don’t fly a lot, I’m wrong in thinking they should have told us? Anyway, frontier denied a refund. I’m thinking we should dispute the charges on CC. Can anyone offer some insight?

16zufnm,2023-10-05 02:16:27,"Frontier Attendant stole my power bank, after telling me he hadn't seen it","TL;DR: Frontier attendant lied to my face &amp; stole my $80 power bank

I left my $80 power bank in the back of my seat when I went to the bathroom. I use it for work.

Seatbelt sign came on, and it was turbulent, so I sat in a different (open) seat, further back. I could see my seat, and charger.

Plane lands, and once I get back to my seat, the charger is missing.

I thought someone stole it; figured a passenger snagged it before I got back to it.

I asked each flight attendant. Two were clearly clueless.

I asked the last attendant at the front of the plane. We'll call him Harry. ""Did you see a black power bank portable charger?""; ""did anyone return a black portable charger to you?""

Harry looked me dead in my eyes, and responds ""no, but you should ask the staff at the gate. I think a passenger brought it up there"".

I ask the staff at the gate, and they haven't seen it.

So, I run to baggage claim to question people who sat near me.

After leaving the ""No return"" area, I catch up to the passenger that sat next to the seat with the charger.

I asked her. She claimed to've given it to Harry, thinking I forgot it. She correctly identified it (it had a blue cord with it). I was dubious of her, and pressed her about stealing it from me, but she seemed genuine.

Since I've left the ""No return"" I can't get back to the gate without going thru security. I was advised to ask Frontier to call their staff.

I go to the Frontier counter, and the staff call the gate and ask.

The gate says the lead flight attendant claims Harry came out with the portable charger, and made an announcement at the gate, once the plane was unloaded. Harry then left, with the power bank.

I wasn't supposed to hear that part I guess, as the Frontier staff kept saying ""he already heard me say the attendant stole it"".

The Frontier Supervisor for the airport refused to face me. I could hear her BSing on the phone to her staff. She knew Frontier was at fault, and that I was aware of the situation. I left my card, and she didn't call.

In total: Harry (the attendant) stole my power bank and lied directly to my face. Frontier, knowing to be at fault, covered up by not allowing me to speak with anyone meaningful.",lesbiyond,17,132,frontierairlines
