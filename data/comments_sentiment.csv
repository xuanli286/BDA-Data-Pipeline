Oct 19 (Reuters) - Elliott Investment Management and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) have begun discussing a potential settlement that would avoid a proxy fight for control of the airline‚Äôs board, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Elliott has proposed a framework that would give it representation on Southwest‚Äôs board but not control, the people said, adding that the talks, which were progressing toward a resolution as of Saturday, have not been finalized and could fall through.

Southwest and Elliott did not immediately respond to a Reuters‚Äô request for comment.

On Monday, the hedge fund officially called for the special meeting to be held on Dec. 10 and submitted proposals to replace eight directors and take control of the board.
The company said it tried to reach a resolution to avoid a fight and noted that the timing of the proposed special meeting was designed to ‚Äúmaximize disruption‚Äù before one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

The activist investor which owns 10% of Southwest‚Äôs common stock, has pushed for months to replace some members of the board, oust CEO Bob Jordan, and review its strategy to improve financial performance and boost the share price.

The airline unveiled several initiatives last month to shore up sagging profits, including partnerships, vacation packages for customers and aircraft sale-leasebacks.
As one of the biggest and busiest activist investors, Elliott has previously pushed for changes at coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O), Salesforce (CRM.N) and Twitter.

Eddie Lambert completely destroyed Sears/Kmart back in the day. I'm sure he and some of his people made money but most everyone else lost money. I can recall some investment guys kept talking about how you should buy the stock and how much value was in it and it never made sense to me.

Of course a lot of stocks can make you a bundle despite having no real value.

Southwest has issues such as technology, seat assignments, people pretending to need early boarding but it doesn't need to be destroyed, nor completely redone.

I get tired of hearing how bags should not be free. If they start charging for bags they need to reduce their fares because on a fare comparison Southwest usually is higher than competitors (when they exist).

Hopefully they will fix their computing systems, improve on time performance and add more service on long flights.

It's actually a very valid question. 

If SWA had enough of the right sized jets, they wouldn't have been on Eliott's radar in the first place. SWA is running 737-800s and MAX8s in situations where a smaller 700 series would be better -- but they are retiring the 700s with no direct replacement due to MAX7 delays. 

OP isn't wrong. Boeing is a hot mess. The MAX7 isn't likely to fly for years at this point, if it even happens at all. It's a shining example of what's wrong with American manufacturing.

The Embraer E-jets such as E195-E2 are worth consideration.They are a smaller alternative for the MAX7. 

Another option is buying an airline with a large 737 fleet such as Sun Country. I couldn't imagine the Feds blocking that merger due to Sun Country's small size as an airline. But that still doesn't help with getting 700 series 737s because Sun Country runs 800s and has a handful of 900s which SWA probably wouldn't know what to do with. 

It's obvious that SWA is going to have to bite the bullet and move to either Airbus A320-series NEOs or E195-E2s or Airbus A220-200s. Unless they start a Tech Ops program like Delta, running old jets like it's Cuba or something, that's their only options. 

Relying on Boeing will only give more fuel to Eliott.

638,lscvjzb,2024-10-17 21:04:02,"Agree with this comment 100%! 

When my toddler outgrew the cosco scenera we got the cosco finale. Lightweight and easier to travel with than the one we use at home. Also relatively cheap for a car seat, and turns out once we made the purchase we found plenty of times at home where an extra car seat came in handy. 

If you need a car seat at your destination, I would recommend bringing it on the plan for the kiddo to sit in. Renting car seats with rental car companies is a huge gamble, I‚Äôve hear stories of there only being infant seats available for a 4yo or missing buckles. You are also welcome to check the car seat either 1) with your checked luggage before security or 2) at the gate where you drop it off right before you step on the plane and pick it up in the same spot when you get off. There‚Äôs a small risk of it getting lost or damaged if you check it. But it does not count against your two free checked bags. 

If grandma is picking you up from the airport and already has a reliable car seat, you can forego brining a car seat altogether. In any other circumstance I personally bring the cosco finale (or scenera) on the plane with us and strap my kiddo into a window seat for the flight. 

Oh one last thing - if you choose not to go the cosco car seat route, you need to triple check the car seat you bring is approved for airplane use. Should be a sticker indicating the approval on the side of the car seat. The gate agent and flight attendant may ask to see it to verify.",dumb_username_69,2,1g5p4wf,t1_lsco9sw,POSITIVE

Reason I say the agent may not have known better is because you would think they would‚Äôve put the call on hold and confirmed since I told him it is on their official site. Either way, I‚Äôm not an unreasonable person. What I do find unreasonable is that just because the flight was taken that they cannot adjust afterwards, especially due to a mandatory evacuation. With more than enough to cover in flight credits and 5x the points, to change it after should be an option.

They are unwilling to refund you because you took actions on your own without following their policies or terms of service.  In other words, you cheated the system, which costs money.

It‚Äôs funny that people forget there are human beings on the other end of these stories and worry about a multi billion dollar company such as Southwest. Curious though, tell me how I cheated the system, knowing that there would not be any flights so they were not losing any money? As I said, this is their third time in less than six months that they have given me incorrect information.

But you didn't, you bought a 2nd ticket instead because you didn't want to get in line with everyone else.  Imagine if everyone tried to do what you did.  It would be chaos for customer service, and that is where losing money occurs.

There is always a risk of fraud with GCs.

that wouldn't have happened. during the pandemic alitalia went bankrupt, was nationalized, and it got reorganized as ITA airlines. most of the employees stayed on. italy is a country that can't set its own monetary policy so they can't just bail out their state airline at will like america does:

>On 10 October 2020, the Italian government signed a decree to allow to reorganize the airline as ITA - Italia Trasporto Aereo S.p.A.[59] On 28 October 2020, it was reported that ITA would buy several assets from Alitalia - Societ√† Aerea Italiana S.p.A., including the brand and the flight codes of Alitalia and Alitalia CityLiner, the International Air Transport Association ticketing code (055), the MilleMiglia frequent-flyer program, and airport slots at London Heathrow (68 weekly slots in summer and 65 in winter).

Southwest has half of Concourse C and 19 gates (downsizing to 11).  Even prior to this announcement, they were flying 60% fewer flights out of Atlanta than AirTran did.  Now I see a ton of Frontier and Spirit planes at ATL on the D and E concourses.  They‚Äôre not having any issues competing with Delta.  Let me put it like this - if AirTran had 6 flights per day from Fort Lauderdale or Miami to ATL, Southwest came in and eventually got down to three flights per day, but those flights were packed full.  Then they moved the flight times to one leaving out of FLL at 6 AM, the second at 5 PM, and the third at 10 PM - well guess what?  Nobody wants to fly at those times of the day regardless if the return flight is at a decent time, so they‚Äôll book Delta or Spirit or anything that flies out at a time they need.  So now the flights are desolate (I was on a 6 AM ghost flight out of Fort Myers to ATL the other day with 8 other passengers).  

Screw Boeing - that isn‚Äôt the issue.  Southwest‚Äôs aircraft utilization is already among the lowest in the industry - they‚Äôre not flying their existing planes enough and now say they‚Äôre going to start selling off aircraft to other airlines (and not talking about the 737-700 dinosaurs but 737-800 and 737-8 Max), potentially selling Boeing delivery slots instead of taking deliveries, and talking about selling jets to leasing companies and then leasing them back to make cash in the short-term while spending more in the long-term.

Their lame excuses suck.  If they didn‚Äôt want the East Coast and Florida, they shouldn‚Äôt have bought AirTran, simple as that.  They can‚Äôt compete because they‚Äôre freaking idiots.

1007,lsnqabe,2024-10-19 16:52:18,"Licensed pilot with CFI/CFII/ATP rating.  I do indeed know what I‚Äôm talking about.  

The vast majority of aircraft they‚Äôre sending to BHM are not near their D-checks (a D-check can cost millions upon millions of dollars and requires a complete overhaul).  Airlines don‚Äôt want to do D-Checks on planes unless they‚Äôre going to be keeping them for another 6-8 years (of course cycles come into play so if a plane typically does a lot more short hops than cross country flying, they‚Äôll hit more heavy maintenance. But the vast majority of them are being sent to BHM because they were nearing C-check which is still expensive (a little over a million $), but nothing like a D-check which can cost $6-8M - think stripping the entire plane down and putting it back together again.  A D-Check on a 737 700 is incredibly uncommon as for their size, they use a lot of gas so their CASM (Cost per Available Seat Mile) are much higher than a comparably sized aircraft like an A-220 (or the Max 7 if it ever gains certification).  So yeah, they‚Äôre like 747-400s - they can be made to fly at a cost, but then the cost to operate is really high.  In fact, it‚Äôs cheaper for SW to fly a Max 800 with 30-40 empty seats than a 737-700.  To prove my point on this, Avelo has purchased a few Southwest 737-700s and performed the C-Check maintenance, along with interior overhaul and livery paint.  Probably $5m out the door for a plane that looks from the outside like it‚Äôs brand new.

As far as European slots, sure - Heathrow - they‚Äôre not going there.  International slots at Newark or JFK are going to be impossible to get.  But people like Norse Air and others seemed to have no issues whatsoever quickly,establishing service to the U.S.  The Max 8 can reach London Gatwick or Paris from BWI - why someone would pay to sit in a Southwest seat that long is beyond me - but I‚Äôm sure if the price was right.",Dense_Amphibian_9595,1,1g4jfe6,t1_lsicw7h,NEUTRAL

If you are flying right before or after Thanksgiving, give yourself 3 hours. Security is where you'll be waiting.¬†


The airport lists security times on their website, and you can check them on the sly: https://www.atl.com/times/¬† I've found them to be accurate in the sense of ""Main says 20 minutes, so main will suck. North says 5 minutes which means north will be faster than main but probably not 5 minutes."" Keep in mind that North has the first class line.¬†


If you are flying out before 9a, the airport will be running dogs. All of those pictures people post of security lines being crazy long and fucking up their travel plans (because they got to the world's busiest airport 45 minutes before their flight two days before Thanksgiving...üôÑüôÑüôÑ) are during dog times. The dogs take a bit longer, and they take up space in the middle of the queue where 100 people would otherwise be. The lines look artificially long.¬†


If your wife is anxious about security, encourage her to pack very few things that need to leave her bag. Check bags! Direct flight means checked bags are going to arrive with y'all. Don't pack liquids and gels and tons of food and things that will require her to unpack her bag at security. I fly A LOT (6-10 times a month at this point). My default carry-on packing situation is a leather tote I love and my purse. My headphones come off my neck, and my bags go in bins. Nothing needs to come out or in or up or down. It makes going through TSA so much nicer for me. Even before I had Pre-Check, nothing was coming out because I wanted the fastest, easiest TSA experience.¬†


I am a ""dad"" flyer. I want to be at my gate 90-120 minutes before my flight. My wife is a ""Chad"" flyer. (She named herself that.) She wants to walk into the airport 45 minutes before her flight and walk up to her gate as the agent is calling for pre-boards. Obviously we compromise. But when we're flying together during the holiday season, we get there early. We do it on my timing preferences because I am much calmer so her day is better.

We would try to be in rows adjacent, or in front and behind each other, but not necessarily all one row. Switch up the adult/kid combo on each flight. 

I didn't expect a small child to be self- entertained the whole flight. The grownup needs to know when to offer  a new treat or activity.

One thing that worked great - make every little thing last longer by wrapping it up. 

I took snippets of tissue paper and ribbon and rolled little toys and occasional treats inside. Lots of paper means it takes a bit of time to unroll and enjoy. I had a little gift bag special for each child, with several little wrapped things inside. It doesn't matter if it's a fruit rollup or a happy meal toy; it becomes a big deal when it has to be unwrapped.

Make some kind of game about when a toy or snack can be selected and unwrapped - for example, let the child pick cards from a shuffled deck. When the child pulls the joker (or a pair, or any face card - whatever you say), they can reach in the bag and unwrap one item. This keeps kids really occupied and makes them engaged with the activity. 

You can also play a version of ""I spy"" with whatever kids' movie being watched - next time you see someone wearing a hat, or anything with a tail,  or any character eating or drinking, or a flower, the person who sees it gets a point. Three points = reach in bag and get to unwrap snack or toy.

It did eventually work out, however, the stress and angst is not worth repeating. If AA doesn't wake up and change their process, they will end another failed entity.

1396,lacyvl5,2024-06-26 21:24:31,"I get your frustration and not questioning your travel experience -- or this experience in particular. I'm just saying that I do fly AA a lot and Aer Lingus even this week and with experience comes additional insight regarding how to handle issues when they pop up. On this last trip I mentioned, I knew I was on Aer Lingus out of GLA and that my OneWorld Emerald status via my Exec Plat as AA was not going to net me free seat selection. So as soon as my ticket was booked, I handled that via X. I know that if I'm on an AA flight, operated by another carriers, I'm going to have 2 different booking references and need to go to the individual airlines' sites in order to manage my booking for seat and meal selection, etc. All in all, unless the ticket was booked absolutely last minute, then there was time to deal with any questions, etc. well before check-in even if check-in (as is often required) needs to happen at the airport. As I said, the only thing I can't speak to is the stand-by issue as that is certainly strange. I'm not a representative of AA nor a shill for them, but offering a counterpoint that I've never had an issue traveling on an AA booked flight which included segments that were British Air flights operated by Aer Lingus. The only thing I don't particularly like is that Aer Lingus isn't a full OneWorld partner so my status benefits don't carry over. Glad it worked out.

Book one pair, then the 2nd pair.

They will ‚Äòlink‚Äô them, but linking is just a free text note that the computer system does not use.  If an agent is doing manual adjustments (due to irops) they may or may not notice it or abide by it.  So know there is a potential to be separated in a worst case scenario (hope for the best have a plan if the worst occurs).

One of the challenges you‚Äôll have is finding a flight with 4 companion cert seats available. That is to say, once you book the first cert, they may not be any cert inventory left.  You won‚Äôt know until after you book. Again an agent would be helpful for this.  If you book one cert but there is no more inventory you at least solve the 3rd reservation with unaccompanied minor issue. 

I‚Äôd plan for at least an hour with an agent (after hold time) to find flights and then complete all three bookings.

1961,lfutjhp,2024-08-01 02:49:30,"My guess is there is an issue with weather and temperature involving taking off with a heavy weight and fuel consumption. There could also be a large amount of unexpected headwinds on the route or weather they have to fly around that the aircraft won‚Äôt have fuel for.

That is an exceptionally long route and SJU is an intermediate point they can stop at along the way.

But due to customs and regulatory reasons they can‚Äôt take the passengers on a whim to SJU instead. But, they likely could in an emergency if they were already en route.

Since they couldn‚Äôt make it, they opted to cancel that one flight and have the plane repositioned to not have to cancel the next outbound flight out of Atlanta back to cape town.

It could also be due to an air craft issue where they thought they could fly to SJU to make it to ATL and they could properly work on it in ATL.

It looks like the plane will be in ATL for 12 hours before flying back to cape town currently.

This is the oddity of ultra-long haul travel. You often to fly to places where you don‚Äôt have assets in place to be back up. Honestly, this falls under normal operation as something that sometimes just happens.

Oddly enough sometimes it‚Äôs better to cancel one flight than have the next 6 heavily delayed and keep the plane on schedule.

They don‚Äôt need to stop in SJU for flight attendants vs. getting them in Atlanta. Even if they picked up personnel in SJU, they have many flights a day on the SJU-ATL route. They would send them to ATL on those existing flights.

The third version of the wing is the closest to what was promised in the brochure when Airbus sold the 350 to DAL 

The software is the best it can be for that particular plane. The software patches are unique to each wing. 

Add a little bit of those and the fact the weather in atl required enough gas to fly to an alternate and then hang out for another 45 minutes. You now need another hour and 15 min worth of gas and gas for the go around at the destination,  so a stop is required because the brochure didn‚Äôt match what delta received.

For long haul routes like this, aircraft can be re-released  from a point along the route. So when you leave jnb legally you can kinda wait and see ,inflight, if you need that extra hour and 15 of gas or not. Sometimes the forecast is so bad that there is no wait and see, your stopping.

But while delays often are miserable, they can be even more so when you‚Äôre waiting on the tarmac, as some of the outage-affected passengers said they were. It doesn‚Äôt help that, in a¬†[summer](https://abcnews.go.com/US/extreme-heat-end-current-forecasts/story?id=111843703)¬†of extreme and¬†[dangerous heat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/heat-index-temperatures-global-cities/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4), planes¬†[can‚Äôt cool cabins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/07/26/plane-cabin-extreme-heat-passengers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)¬†on the ground as well as they can in the sky.

If your flight is stuck on the tarmac past a certain point, airlines may owe you. But there‚Äôs a catch.

The protections for U.S. airline passengers are ‚Äúrudimentary‚Äù compared to in Europe, said Eric Napoli, the chief legal officer at claims management company AirHelp. ‚ÄúThe best you‚Äôre going to get is what airlines want to offer you in the terms and conditions you have for that airline.‚Äù

You‚Äôll have to advocate for yourself.

***Your basic rights while on the tarmac***

Tarmac delays have shortened significantly since the Transportation Department established customer-protection rules for delays, said William McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project. But some tarmac stops still can drag maddeningly on.

Depending on how long you‚Äôre stuck on the tarmac, airlines in the United States have certain obligations.

Per¬†[Department of Transportation rules](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/tarmac-delays), at the two-hour mark, airlines must provide their passengers with food, water,¬†[‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù cabin temperatures,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/07/26/plane-cabin-extreme-heat-passengers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14)¬†access to functioning toilets and medical assistance, if needed. After that ‚Äî before three hours on the tarmac for domestic flights, and before four for international flights ‚Äî an aircraft must provide customers the option to deplane. The exception to this rule, Napoli said, is if a safety issue is preventing the plane from returning to the gate.

The same tarmac rules apply for arriving planes. If travelers are not provided with these essential provisions, Napoli recommends filing a complaint with the airline as soon as possible.

So, on a good day,  once you check your bags, they're going to the destination airport on your original itinerary. There's no real stopping that. That's not a Delta thing, that's universal. They aren't going to go back and pull your bag off of the speeding conveyor system or dig through a cargo hold's worth of Tetris'ed luggage to get someone's bag off the plane. 

So Scenario 1: it goes to the original destination. It'll wait in the Delta luggage claim office until you get there, and if you beat it, you can pick it up from the destination airport. 

On a good day, sometimes if the airline is at fault, they'll send someone to deliver luggage to you. If you willingly (albeit under duress) cancelled, they probably won't, especially with the enormous volume of bags right now. 


Now.... Where things get dicey for you. Unless that first flight got cancelled by Delta, your bags have or will connect through ATL.

Scenario 2: If your original flight out of ABQ  arrived at ATL before your original connection, your bag *might* end up at the destination still. 

Scenario 3: If that connection flight left first or is cancelled, your bag is very likely going to be in a biiiiiiig sea of bags at ATL also affected by all of this mess. The pictures of the ATL baggage situation are wild....I don't think I've ever quite seen anything like it. In that case, it's probably going to take some time to get your bag back. I'm not sure what scale of time. It would most likely get sent back to your initial airport. 

In the meantime, track where your bag is in the Delta app, so you at least know the airport it's at currently.  To get it, You may need to fill out a form for lost luggage. They're usually really quick about connecting people to lost luggage (or luggage that's in the shuffle of things). But by the looks of some of the pics online of ATL, there are thousands of other people all trying to get reconnected with their luggage. 

This is such a frustrating thing to go through, and the customer facing employees at Delta aren't spared from that frustration. I feel so bad for them. The crowdstrike thing was like the sneeze that kicked off an avalanche for Delta. Specifically Delta because it sounds like the execs really did a number stripping down IT infrastructure and personnel, outsourcing IT personnel, and a baffling lack of continuity plans. 

Nearly every system is impacted somehow or another. There are numerous reports of flight crews, including pilots, who can't access scheduling info or support. Sets of planes in the fleet that are ""missing"" in their internal systems (all of the 717s were mentioned at one point, and ex lion air 737-9s...).

 Passengers are getting to gates about to board and they're short one crew member and end up having to delay or cancel, or have no crew.  The expected crew have no idea they're supposed to be scheduled there because they can't access scheduling and are on hold for 8-10+ hours (there was a post about that too). But they're busy working and are bottlenecked wherever they are.  Even if they do know, they may not be able to get there because everything else is bottlenecked. And then say a plane is cleared for taxi in a hub like ATL, the wait time to actually take off is gonna be nuts.  It's a damn mess. All of it. 
 

None of this is the fault of the person at the airport check-in counter, or working the ramp, or working the luggage area, or the gate agents, or the airport level managers (""red coats"") or the pilots or flight attendants or ground crew.  They all know their procedures and are following them. They're all working with a failed system, and inadequate procedures in place and are adapting as much as possible. 

Now, if you want to lodge a complaint (and do!), by all means write one directed toward the corporate execs who made the looong series of poor decisions that led to this. 

The employees are doing everything they can and are worn and torn down. Some are being pulled back from their personal leave time. Salaried employees are jumping in and volunteering grueling amounts of time to help with bottlenecks and learning on the fly bc corporate didn't provide any training. 

I didn't intend to write a novel, there's just a lot to unpack. I hope you've got all of your belongings soon and that things settle down before long.",HairyPotatoKat,2,1e8rc6z,t3_1e8rc6z,NEUTRAL

If there aren't direct flights to your originating airport, you could tinker around and see if it'd be more beneficial to stick with one airline, or to get into the US on one and then connect on another. (Book enough time for customs, baggage, and security at the connection.)

JetBlue, for instance, has a handful of options from Santo Domingo to JFK. That'd at least get you back in the US, then go from there either continue on JetBlue, or switch to American, Southwest... 

Idk about compensation beyond refunded fare. A lot of people are in your situation, and this was way outside of Delta's control, affecting a lot of industries. Hospitals in my city had to cancel all non-emergency surgeries, some government operations are gummed up, people have lost work, businesses have lost money. Employees of affected companies are scrambling to get things back to normal. It sucks for everyone and I hope that crowdstrike makes it right.

For now though, I hope you're able to find an alternative solution to get back sooner.

Additionally, when the delay or cancelation is within Delta's control (i.e. maintenance or staffing) they will typically cover the hotel if you have an overnight delay. Delta may cover hotels for CrowdStrike related cancellations - but it is an evolving situation so monitor Delta's official announcements. For those outside their control (weather or ATC) they typically will only provide the rebooking (or a refund if you prefer to cancel and no longer fly).

From your post it's unclear what the cause of the delay was, but that will control what you are entitled to.

Additionally, if you have travel insurance (either purchased for the trip, or from a premium credit card), you can submit a claim to them for the delay and any documented expenses.

However, in either case you won't receive any financial compensation for any intangible items, like a missed day of work. You may receive some SkyMiles as a customer service gesture if you submit a complaint.

My own two cents, having gone through a MUCH smaller scale (but multi-day) situation domestically: If I was in your position right now, I'd choose to get as far as I could today even though it's uncertain whether you'll get to JFK on the originally intended flight. 

Get to Athens. Even with an 8 hour delay, you still  have at least a 6 hour window to make your next flight - more if the flight into JFK ends up delayed. 

 Go into it being mentally prepared that you may or may not make the connection flight. Start looking around for places to stay in Athens if you end up needing it, that will take the stress off later. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst.

Second, mechanics have seen what the unions will do first-hand, as well as how other mechanics are treated by these same unions. Teamsters by far and wide, was the worst choice that we could've been given. Their representation is akin to high school debate clubs, and their overall bargaining power is not near the level we expect to compare ourselves to with the likes of ALPA. The preferred organization would be another ALPA drive like there was in the early 2000's, and I'm confident that if this were to happen, mechanics would've signed >50%. Teamsters would not be able to hold a candle to what could be done with ALPA, and is apparent with how UAL feels and the ALPA drives they have held. Signing with Teamsters would've given us no major industry increases over that of our rivals, a certain reduction of Delta mechanic AMT positions, and heavy stagnation. It would be AMFA 2.0.

Or are there retention statistics that support the position that unionized airlines have less retention based on union representation?

And it may take considerable time for it to all shake put, but it's almost always better in the long run. You get into periods like now for pilots where demand was so high, we got a really good contract. I think of it like the stock market. When times are good, you can take advantage and bargain for a great contract. But that contract will also protect you when times are not so good. Plus wages is just one aspect. A good contract can improve a lot of other areas of your work life such as time off, vacation, sick time, workers protections. I would rather have ""teeth"" against my company and a contract gives you that. Is it always perfect? No. My company constantly tries to roll us over on our contract but we can fight back. Without a union or a contract, the company can just as easily takes things away as given. It's delayed gratification.

I would agree there are some companies that do that, but I don't think that applies to any of the airlines. They will chew you up if they need to, especially if there is a weak labor market with lost of applicants

Edit to add: I also wouldn't compare it to pilots. Compare to other similar group. Below wing to below wing, in service to in service etc. Again, Delta FA are doing good because the company can afford to throw money at them to not unionize. That lead won't last forever.

For travel on KLM-operated, Delta-marketed flights this certificate may be used to upgrade on published fares booked in Y, B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T, X or V class and all fare classes upgrade into Z class. For travel on KLM-operated flights marketed by KLM, fares booked in Y, B, M, K, H, L, Q, T, N, R, or V class are eligible to upgrade into Z class. For travel on KLM-operated flights marketed by AF, this certificate may be used to upgrade on published fares booked in Y, B, M, K, H, L, Q, T, N, R, or V class into Z class. For travel on Air France-operated flights marketed by Air France and booked in Y, B, M, K, H, L, Q, T, N, R, or V class, customers can upgrade into A class (Premium Economy), or they can upgrade from W, S, or A class into Z class (Business Class).

For travel on Aeromexico operated, Delta marketed flights this certificate may be used to upgrade on Delta\`s published fares booked in W, Y, B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T, X or V class and all fare classes upgrade into Aeromexico\`s O class.

> On top of that, Hawaiian Airlines announced that they scrambled a flight out at 1am the next day, well after we'd cancelled our travel package and while in the middle of the call with customer service.

Yes, because there was zero room in your itinerary for error, you abandoned your trip and began requesting compensation immediately upon the diversion. A 1AM flight from Oakland would arrive on Oahu at 3AM, if you had not cancelled your trip, you would have gotten there a day late. 

> I just can't get over just how much hassle and frustration and uncertainty we had to go through.

You booked a 3-day trip with a toddler on an airline that operates one flight a day. No form of travel is 100% reliable, even if the equipment is fine, a medical diversion would have resulted in exactly the same outcome on your end, with even less compensation due to you. Not purchasing travel insurance, on a three day trip to hawaii, was a mistake.

If you seat 2E/F Then you‚Äôll see Maui and most of the east coast/waikiki  on your way in before turning into pattern for landing.

Currently, the two free bags only applies to the cardholder, not the student or your aunt that you bought the tickets for or your spouse/travel partner.

For example:  say you want four bags to be checked in free if you and your spouse/travel partner have separate (not joint) HA credit cards?  Book separately using your own HA credit card for your ticket and then your spouse/travel partner purchase their ticket on the website with their HA credit card. 

Having the card alone does NOT give you the benefit.  It's called a loyalty card. Hope this helps anyone out there using the HA credit card.

If you used a credit/debit card other than the Hawaiian credit card the benefit doesn't apply.  Also, if you redeem miles - use the HA credit card to pay for the balance.

This is something I‚Äôm unclear on. The Barclay‚Äôs website doesn‚Äôt say anything about the $10 in-flight credit. The Hawaiian Airlines website says it is a perk of Hawaiian Airlines elites, so I don‚Äôt think you need to use the HA credit card.

They made a drastic change to the dates on a ticket I booked next March. The new change doesn't work with my vacation schedule, and apparently, there is an Alaska / Hawaiian flight combo instead of a complete Hawaiian flight where I am flying from. I called them to tell them I would like to keep my original flight time even though it's now operated on Alaska / Hawaiian. They kept offering me earlier dates than my vacation time, which they mentioned were flights operated only by Hawaiian. I mentioned I could not fly earlier than the date I booked.

I then mentioned I would be open to flying on a partner airline since it is mentioned on their website they can do that. They wouldn't budge, and they wouldn't book me on the Alaska / Hawaiian flight combo either. I kept mentioning the flight change was their doing, and they would need to reschedule me on a flight that works for me.

Both of the CS agents at the end said, ""You can just cancel your flight."" üòí

**Additional Fees for Oversize Baggage**. When a bag exceeds an Outside Linear Dimension of 62 inches (157 cm), it will incur an additional oversize charge as follows, which is in addition to the Standard Bag fee and any overweight fees.

   1. Baggage with an Outside Linear Dimension greater than 62 inches (157 cm), but not exceeding an Outside Linear Dimension of 80 inches (203 cm):
      1. Between points within the State of Hawaii, the additional oversize baggage fee is $35.00 per oversized piece.
      2. For Domestic travel that is not wholly within the State of Hawaii, the additional oversize baggage fee is $200.00 for each oversized piece.
   2. Baggage in excess of the stated dimensions above will not be accepted, except as expressly provided elsewhere in this¬†Rule 18.

Alaska and Hawaiian are merging mileage programs next year. If you are able, just start getting credit cards to load up on Alaska and Hawaiian miles, and they‚Äôll combine next year.

A different arbitrage you can do, Alaska basic fares earn 30% miles towards status, while Hawaiian earn 100%. So it‚Äôs possible to earn Hawaiian status buying very cheap fares. I estimate $1300 for 4x RT tickets HNL-SFO, and that gets you status.

Because Hawaiian is a destination airline, much of the program is aimed at people who come to hawaii on vacation every year. If you live here, and can fly Hawaiian a few times between the mainland each year, you can get status, where you would need to fly 3x more, or purchase more expensive tickets, with Alaska.

What i learnt is the best usage is to fly to hawaii, mexico, bermuda, basically long haul flights at peak season.

There are some years where we can‚Äôt maximize the companion cert value. So we typically use it for a short haul flights such as SEA-LAX or SEA-LAS. Normally we barely breakeven after factoring the annual card fees, but we just shrug it off. It just means we havent maximized the companion pass value.¬†

3280,lo6gpnw,2024-09-21 16:16:57,"....I see them operating their long ange 787-9s primarily on their international routes as well as long distance domestic routes (New York, Boston, and Dallas).  Seattle and Portland would be a stretch (particularly Portland) given the 787-9 has more seats to fill than the A330-200 (the 787-9 seats 290 in mixed class configuration while the A330-200 seats 250). If they went with the -8 model that would be closer to the A330 in capacity (242 passengers in mixed class).  

Also Hawaiian has a standing order for just 9 787s which again would likely be  prioritised for their Pacific international routes and routes to the east coast/Dallas.  They currently have 24 A330-200s and a single A330-300 which means if all the Airbus aircraft are disposed of, 737NG and Max aircraft would likely take their place on west coast to Hawai'i routes unless Alaska Air Corp places an additional order for 787-9s (or -8s on the west coast coast routes).

The cost of a single (new) 787-9 is 249.5$ million so to replace the remaining 15 A330-200s would come to around 3.7 billion USD mot taking into account any fleet discount. Going with pre owned 787s would come to a total of around 2.5 billion USD   If they  went with 787-8s would still be expensive as each goes for 239 million USD saving only about 115 million on the total order compared the -9 series for the same number of aircraft.

As a condition of the merger, Alaska Air Group is also assuming 900 million USD in debt owed by Hawaiian, so not sure if they are that financially healthy to absorb such a massive expense even spread out over say a 10 - 20 year period.

I'm not 100% sure if the 195 E2 is a common type rating with the 170/190 type. Even if it is, you run into the scope conundrum. Alaska Airlines per s√© doesn't have a 175 program; Horizon does:

 If you send Horizon to Hawaii operate the 195 E2, then you open the scope can of worms because it's a regional in Hawaii (not allowed by current HA pilot/FA contracts) and also greater than 76 seats (not allowed by Alaska's pilot contract)

If you make the 195 E2 a Hawaiian or mainline Alaska fleet, then there really isn't any cost implementation savings because neither pilot nor FA group is trained on the airframe.

Uplift is just giving you a loan‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no reason they would need a partnership in order to loan you money to sell you a ticket.

Collaboration doesn‚Äôt mean anything legally binding. They can argue that since Uplift has a link to the Hawaiian airlines website, they are in collaboration.

It was my first time flying Frontier, and just like you, will probably be my last.  We had upgraded to not have to worry about the carry ons.  Roundtrip we ended up paying around $500 for the round trip from DC to PDX (with a layover in Denver both ways).  Two long ass travel days.  

The seats are the worst I've ever sit in - felt like a park bench.  The stuff they charge for - carry on bags? What dystopian nightmare is this? lol I get the budget aspect of it, but that's one thing i'd be fine with paying extra for the ticket for.

3594,ls6rfyi,2024-10-16 19:55:54,"This can happen with any airline. 

I fly Frontier when I can go personal item only, don‚Äôt need a connection and don‚Äôt have any set place to be in case of delays since most of the flights I would take with them (or any other budget airline) only have one flight a day and only fly that route a few days a week.  Checked bags or carry on fees eat into the cost savings. 

Most of my flights are tied to other expenses like hotels or events I want to attend so typically the only time I fly budget airlines is to visit family when there isn‚Äôt a set time I need to be there or my job (or manager) will have issues if I‚Äôm delayed on my return.  

I stopped flying Frontier when I was working because any delays could cause a problem if I couldn‚Äôt get back to work as planned (personal item only meant my work laptop wouldn‚Äôt fit and I couldn‚Äôt nod my job with a tablet that I usually would bring). Now that I retired I recently flew them since I could deal with not going if the outbound flight was cancelled and I would extend my stay if the return one couldn‚Äôt be booked for a few days if if was delayed or cancelled.  

When flying any budget airline or even legacy carrier with limited flight schedules, you need to book with eyes open and think about what your plan B is if your trip is disrupted.

There‚Äôs a protocol that should have been followed and unfortunately the gate agent didn‚Äôt seem to follow the proper protocol nor maintain correspondence with you guys or the specific frontier department which we send emails to back and forward. In a scenario like this, whenever I work an oversold flight I ensure to tell the passenger to stay in the gate area while I wrap up the flight and close the loading bridge door.

Once that is complete, then the gate agent has to verify your personal details including email, phone, address to ensure that the voucher will be properly received. Without this information properly accounted for in the system, the vouchers will not be sent. The agent should also document the reservation. 

Sometimes there is a high volume of emails received. So getting compensated will usually take an hour if this is the case. But the agent shouldn‚Äôt wait to re accommodate you on the next available flight. They can do that and then take care of sending the proper email.

Meaning someone who is willing to pay could take it and whoever didn‚Äôt pay and got it by status is bumped. There‚Äôs a trick to this frequent fliers are aware of. The later you check in, the better chance you have at a random seat before row 11. Row 11 is where they start assigned the ‚Äúno chosen seat‚Äù people. So if you check in say 2 hours before flight, and they started 22 hours ago with row 11 back, and then everyone checks in to fill all of those rows, you automatically get a seat closer to the front (if it‚Äôs a full plane and the back rows are all now assigned automatically). It‚Äôs never 1 or 2. Starts at 3. Also, they are cheaper to upgrade to right before takeoff because it‚Äôs the last chance for the airline to make money on that seat as a paid upgrade. So, if you check in like 2 hours before you usually can pay like $15-$17 and get one of the front seats for super cheap (or even free if they auto assign you).

Ere on the side of caution, because they have a box up front to check and if it doesn't fit in that, they'll charge you $80 (domestic). They won't let you board unless you pay. I have seen people skip the box because they felt confident, and they ended up missing their flights when they didn't have enough to pay.

And that is really the hidden fees. They aren't hidden, because you already know you don't want to check a bag, but if you are even a quarter of an inch off, they charge more than standard airlines do for the 'carry on included' price. Stuff like that is the main thing. You have to pay for pretty much anything other than water to drink and any decent food. But if you don't care about that and do care about legroom?

I‚Äôd never fly Frontier (or Allegiant) if I had to be dependent on either as my only source to get to a timed event.  Flew Frontier last year to Orlando and arrived the day before our cruise..had both cars prepped and ready to go in case we had to drive if the flight got cancelled.  Also we have booked a fully refundable flight on SW that left after the Frontier flight time to have a strong plan b in place.  This past May had my flight to Tampa get straight up cancelled with no explanation.

Another thing that drives me nuts about Frontier is when they cancel or delay they will only email and not text you.  This has happened to everyone in my family and some coworkers so keep checking your email.

Some gates are religious about checking your personal bag size - Cincinnati almost always, Tampa almost never.  

The bathrooms aren‚Äôt cleaned well enough either, have yet to fly on a Frontier flight with a high standard of clean bathroom.

I've been flying SAN-DEN a lot. They show an OTP of 68%... and it's either 30 minutes early or late. LOL. That is more due to the slot/single runway situation at SAN, than F9 itself.

4433,lqynmzh,2024-10-09 00:37:49,"ETA another thought I had. We had an agent several years ago exploit a loophole in our system to try to send fraudulent refund checks to his friends and family. The whole scam was dumb as hell for a lot of reasons, chief among them was all his transactions were associated to his user account. So when we noticed these odd refunds we were immediately able to identify that it was just one agent doing them and who he was. I would try to get in contact with Frontier corporate to report this behavior because it stinks to high heaven of CC theft to me

.  This is not in any way PCI compliant so I personally would not send my CC number through this channel. If this is a common practice on Frontier's part they should probably get a huge spanking from their merchant services provider.

I direct a customer service unit with a contact center BPO and we would neverrrrre everrrrrrrr ask for a plain text CC. We use a secure payment portal software that pops up a separate window or sends a caller to an automated system to record and process a CC number, then sends a confirmation to our system when the CC goes through successfully, then routes the customer back to the agent to finalize the transaction. Our agents aren't even allowed to keep pens at their desks because if they do happen to hear or see a CC number they can't write it down without a pen.

For refunds, if the transaction is within, I think, 90 days there is absolutely no reason why they can't refund to the CC without the card number. If it's older than that our system defaults to a check refund.  I would imagine companies that don't want to do check refunds might need a CC entered to manual refund but again, never in plain text and usually not directly to the agent.",Paprikasj,1,1fwe0df,t3_1fwe0df,NEGATIVE
