,,"So today I had a flight out of Phoenix that had alot of empty seats on it. I asked the gate agent if there were enough empty seats  for me to have a complimentary car seat seat. The gate agent said sure no problem and I’ll also give you a whole row to yourself. Anyways I’m situated with my daughter in her car seat (she’s 1 and I’m flying alone with her) and a different gate agent comes up and says “you’ll need to check that” and I was like “oh actually the gate agent told me I could use it for my car seat I asked her before the flight” and she said “no you can’t you didn’t pay for the seat. I was like what does that matter if it’s empty anyways? And she goes you didn’t pay for it and you can’t use it. I’ll give you a minute to get situated  and come back for it. I decided not to make a scene and try to enjoy the rest of my flight but my car seat fits in the overhead compartment so I put it up there (again this is a virtually empty flight  so there was no shortage of bin space). She comes back and says, exactly like this,  “get your car seat out for me”. And I said so now it can’t be in the overhead bin? And she goes no because you didn’t pay for it. Holding my 1 year old I open it up and she goes “get it out for me”. Wtf???! I’m holding my baby!?!? Anyways the lady behind me goes that’s enough you’re just being nasty now and gets it down for me. 

My question is - is this a legitimate thing? I would understand if maybe there was some sort of liability thing related to the usage of the seat? But I have done this same thing on empty southwest flights with no problem. Despite that, there’s no reason I couldn’t put my car seat in the overhead compartment. It fit fine and closed fine and I wasn’t taking space from any other patrons. Also I should mention I’m an American Airlines platinum status.

jo5yg4u,2023-06-15 07:36:25,"A few major things to consider because there is no way to connect two reservations if purchased separately. Hope this helps…

1. If you’re checking bags, they will not be checked all the way through &amp; will be a nightmare getting out of security to claim &amp; recheck them for your next flight. 3 hours may not be enough. 

2. Because your flights are not connected, if there is a delay on your first flight, they will NOT provide accommodations during delay or automatically rebook for the next leg. This will also be a nightmare as the JFK-DOH flight on AA is very often delayed. I know from personal experience it has been delayed over 12 hours the last two days.

3. Schedule changes are very likely from here to December that may shorten that connection time which may cause you not to have enough time between connections. Then you have to worry about rebooking the connection which will probably cost because it is in a separate reservation. If it’s the same reservation they will accommodate free of charge.",Adventurous-Ad403,2.0,1498r94,na,,,,,,

,,"I have been flying American Airlines solely for about 20 years. But have noticed a shift in their policies, processes, and customer satisfaction. 

1.They refuse to return a travel credit of $525 that we were forced to cancel the ticket and rebook due to a glitch at booking in their system. The credit expired and per their policy cannot be re-instated under any circumstances. There was never a prompt or reminder that this credit was coming to expiration. The one time I tried to apply the credit to a booking flying to London, the system had a ""glitch"" and I was not able to apply. I see a recurring theme here. 

2. Their call centers are overseas and the reps are never able to resolve any issue. Their only response to a request is a standard ""NO"". No matter what the circumstance, usually some error with the app or website. Requesting to speak with an agent here in the US, am told they are unable to transfer me. I make the request because I usually have better luck. 

3. I opened an American Airlines Executive Mastercard with a promotion offer of 40k miles and $200 statement credit for spending $5k within 90 days which I met the requirement and never recieved the credit. I have made several attempts to resolve, they simply will not honor the offer. 

4. I have 5 vouchers for seat upgrades that I have attempted to use multiple times at booking but the app/website never gives you the option to apply at booking. These may only be applied at time of booking and I have never been able to use them. Calling in you hold for 45 minutes and then their agents say there is nothing they can do because I have already completed the booking. 

5. They email your offers for rental cars and such. I've tried twice to book one of these offers and both times when I went to pick up the rental, the company had nothing in their system for the reservation. Even though I was able to show them proof of booking and the special price... both times I was told they did not have that price available. The Advantage Desk was no help as they were not open to assist and no other department could help.

kk7jxvl,2024-01-30 11:34:15,"How much is each ticket worth?

If these are what AA calls “flight credits,” here’s an example of how you can extend at least some of the value of these:

 * Example, you have a “flight credit” worth $500.
 * Find the cheapest one-way flight between any two cities. I believe it can’t be a basic economy fair, but main cabin is fine.
 * After booking, AA will issue you a trip credit for the difference in price. This credit will be good for one year from the date it is issued.
 * If you’re not going to use the one-way flight, cancel the one-way flight.

You’ll likely get the one-way flight price back in a flight credit with the origins expiration date, but the rest of the money will be on a new credit that you have a whole other year to use.",TrowTruck,1.0,1ae7yib,na,,,,,,

If it’s essential that you make your flight (e.g., it’s the departure to your destination for the day and you’re trying to board a cruise ship), I would try to get to get a longer connection.

It’s funny how stressful little delays can be when you’re trying to make a 46 minute connection. Last time we pushed back from the departure gate and the pilot said, “uhhhhhh… looks like there’s a pretty full queue to the runway so they’ve asked that we hold here for about 10 minutes.” And then when we arrived it was, “uhhhhhh… we’ve been assigned to gate C23 but it there’s another plane in our spot.

If it ends up costing more, I would just leave it alone. As long as OP doesn’t make a habit of skiplagging, likely there will be no consequence to doing it just this once.

Also, it probably goes without saying, but do not check any bags on this flight. Also there is a risk if OP is not in an early boarding group, that it’s a full flight so they should understand there’s a risk of being required to gate check a carryon.",TrowTruck,1.0,1801qan,ka30uz8,,,,,,

I have a flight coming up that goes from Greensboro, NC to Charlotte, NC then from CLT to Orlando, Florida. 

I booked this as having me go through two different airports in my NC state as it was cheaper than a direct flight. 

However, I have a short connection once I get to Charlotte which has me a bit antsy.  

Would AA flag me if I completely skipped the Greensboro leg of the trip and just drove to Charlotte and left from there??? I am the same distance away from both airports so it doesn’t matter to me travel time.

Their website says they cover up to $3800 if it’s a domestic flight and I provide everything they need but now they want a receipt which I do not have because the luggage was a gift.

   * No (except for Hawaii has special rules that are constantly). No proof of vaccine is needed to fly domestically, you will be required to wear a mask during your flight.
* Are they serving food and alcohol on the plane?
   * Currently, only first-class will receive be served food and consume alcohol. If you are flying in the main cabin, packing a snack is suggested.
* My flight was delayed, what can I do to get compensation?
   * If your flight is delayed for weather reasons, you will not receive any compensation. If it was delayed for maintenance or another reason, you can complain to AA and will likely receive miles. If your flight is pushed to the next day, they will put you up in a hotel for the night.
* My bag didn't make it with me, what should I do?
   * You must go to the baggage claim office at the airport. You may purchase clothing and toiletries. Keep the receipts and you will be reimbursed later. It will likely take a month from when the form is submitted to when you receive a check in the mail.
* I purchased a non refundable fare ticket and now I can't go, what are my options?
   * If you booked a basic economy ticket, there is nothing that can be done.
   * If your ticket is not a basic economy ticket, you can cancel the flight for a credit. This can be done in the app or on the website.
   * If you purchased travel insurance, you must go through the insurance agency, not AA.
* I booked a ticket through \*insert anyone besides AA\* and I need to make a change how do I do this?
   * You must contact the agency you booked the ticket with. They ""own"" the rights to that ticket and need to make and changes unless it is the day of travel, then AA can help you.

,,"In March, my mother, my sister, and I flew direct from Dallas to Auckland, New Zealand. We were scheduled to return to Dallas direct from Auckland on a Sunday. After getting through security and waiting for 3 hours, our flight was completely cancelled.  

We were told that the next flight would be on Tuesday, and that all of our meals and the hotel would be covered until then. We were shuttled to a hotel near the airport and given a voucher for dinner. The next day, we were moved to a different hotel, and again received a voucher for dinner. They did not cover breakfast or lunch, and the move was a bit of an inconvenience.   

We arrived at the airport for our rescheduled flight on Tuesday, and waited in line to check in for over 2 hours - and then that flight was cancelled as well. As we needed to get home for work, I immediately called American directly and got rebooked on another airline with two layovers (much less convenient than our direct flight, but better than waiting another 2 days for the flight they wanted to put us on).   

Since then, I have been emailing with one person from American’s Customer Relations team. It took them over a month to even respond to my inquiry regarding reimbursement for the additional meals and expenses (there is no phone number for this department, believe it or not) and after all of that, they are offering us each a $100 flight credit.   

I was caught up in the Southwest meltdown in December, and while that was riddled with issues, each of us did receive a $250 flight voucher plus 25,000 Southwest points. That was also handled much more promptly than this issue.   

I understand that flying is a gamble, but we missed three days of work, paid for additional pet boarding and food, and were never offered anything for our trouble until I reached out to American directly.",mathprof918,,,,14ppiuc,2023-07-04 01:36:31,Issues with Compensation for Repeatedly Cancelled Flights,0.0,2.0,AmericanAir

liv9uls,2024-08-19 10:40:39,"Oddly enough this is Bozeman to a small airport in the east.  Flight is over half empty and is just over 30 days out.  It varied between 70k and 45k (points) for a one way Biz Class.  It has stabilized within the range of 46 - 66.  5 minutes ago it was 46 and now it is 48.5.  But last week it was bouncing around all over the place from 46.5 to 80, constantly.  I just don't get what the pricing algorithm is looking at.  But, I swear they know when you are in there checking routes and instantly jack rates up.  That seems highly unfair.  I could see day to day changes but this is pure price gouging.  However, if you are bound and determined to beat them at their own game and stick with it you can beat them at your own game, it just takes time and effort.",toddreg,1.0,1esubb4,litdnx7,,,,,,
