Next time we flew with them (stupid, I know) I found out that you can’t check in your minor on the app you have to do it at the terminal which is a nightmare in Oakland and extended the time you’re in the airport with a little crazy person which is far from ideal. Needless to say I won’t fly them again.",Alternative_Gate9583,2,1bxmskk,na
kyg1nv5,2024-04-07 16:56:43,"FWIW it looks like the plane you were supposed to fly on is flying back to HNL tomorrow. Which probably means maintenance issue on that particular plane which should be fixed by tomorrow’s flight. They sent you back (assuming you flied the delayed flight) on the plane that came in tonight, immediately turning it around in SAN.

Regarding if it was ever really ‘cancelled’ that was probably a major f*ck up by the SAN operations. If they indeed announce and post on the boards ‘cancelled’ and told you to book another airline, then they should honor some form of refund. I will say despite it being a major miscommunication, probably by someone who spoke too soon or gave erroneous information, prepare that they may only offer you flight credit.

In the future, it would be wisest to always try to arrange your rebooked flight through whichever airline you’re flying. If they cancel the flight, they are obligated to get you rebooked on another one of their flights, or on a partner airline (if available) at no additional cost.

I’ll make the same suggestion I made on the PDX post.
1) Get in line to talk to a gate agent while simultaneously calling the reservations line, get help from whoever gets to you first.
2) Travel insurance. If you have it, see if anything is covered so far. If not, consider getting some in the future. This shit can happen with every airline.",Temporary_Cow_2340,3,1bxmskk,na

I would recommend Oahu for a first time visiter with kids. While I think Kauai is the most beautiful of the islands, there are more varied experiences here and Kauai north shore in December is often rainy. 

By the way, last week in December in any year is an expensive week and availability will be limited.  We used to rent out our condo to vacationers and the last two weeks of December were the hottest weeks. 

Depending on budget and ages of kids and your interests you might choose among Waikiki (most popular), Ko Olina (westside multi-resort development built around four man made lagoons), and Turtle Bay (single luxury resort, north shore). 

I’d recommend considering Ko Olina in particular because you might be able to snag a 2 or 3 BR unit with kitchen on a beautiful beach by searching Beach Villas at Ko Olina or Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club on VRBO or similar search sites.",Rare-Oil-6550,5,1g8w929,na

west side ko olina is better for resort ish vibe and beach/water but it can be very pricey, pricey even for HI, also there's not much else out there and it's a trek to get anywhere else on the island due to traffic, rush hour to the west side or leeward is soul sucking",bulldogsm,3,1g8w929,na

lt1ls94,2024-10-22 02:17:58,"Probably not the right sub for this, as there are ones dedicated to visiting Hawai'i and specific islands. That said, it depends what you want to do. O'ahu is a good mix of urban environments with plenty of shopping and dining options at all price points, along with accessible, enjoyable outdoor activities. 

Maui is definitely very expensive, especially when you consider that it's currently better to stay in Wailea. Lahaina/Ka'anapali area is still a shadow of its formers self as the area continues to rebuild after the wildfires. Even though the resorts and their restaurants have reopened, many of the less expensive, better mom &amp; pop options remain shuttered. However, Maui is home to Haleakalā, which is a very interesting place to visit. It's also the second most urbanized of the islands. 

Kaua'i is often great for people that want to do a lot of outdoor activities (hiking the Nā Pali coast) or just lounge around the resort. It's often described by visitors as one of the more laidback of the islands, though it's the smallest of the main Hawaiian Islands. 

The Big Island has a lot of large, nice resorts on the West side of the island, though there isn't much to do there unless you're willing to drive out 1-3 hours to other parts of the island. The East side of the island is home to just two large hotels, both of which aren't all that great in terms of quality. Again, if you're willing to drive and want to do outdoor activities, there are tons to do from Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, to zip lining over a waterfall, exploring a green sand beach, etc. The Big Island also has one of the most interesting food scenes around if you know where to look.",Kyo46,2,1g8w929,na

Keep in mind there is no way to hold Minicoochi accountable to really keeping the Hawaiian Airlines brand, or whoever takes the helm afterwards. The brand will disappear. 

Coochi really wants Alaska to go international and this is his shortcut. Hawaiian will have the new 787s and the international gates already.  Don’t be surprised if the 787s end up just going from the mainland to other international destinations.  I wonder how it will impact Hawaiian Airlines’ relationship with JAL and Korean Airlines.

As I’ve flown on Alaska and Hawaiian, I can say that the service on Alaska is far less than what Hawaiian provides. Since the service will reflect the amount of pay crew will receive, I would predict that Hawaiian will drop many services and duties while in the air to justify lowering pay. 

Coochi and Ingram have been focusing on the lack of overlap of routes, but if you look at just the Mainland-Hawaii routes, they will then have more percentage of routes than all the other US carriers, so don’t expect any relief for consumers, it’ll most likely inflate.

lamdv01,2024-06-28 10:17:22,"So, the numbers you're looking at are the price for a one-way award ticket. Whether you're charged the Main Cabin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 depends on revenue management, which is a cryptic, proprietary process airlines use to price out their tickets. However, if demand for certain routes/dates is high, it's a safe bet that the prices will be, too. 

The prices for first class are the same as main - they're for one-way tickets. So, you know, if you're getting Main Cabin 3 or higher, it makes more sense to book first class if you're seeing First Class 1 award prices. 

Your specific dates are close to Thanksgiving, hence the higher prices. Your only options are really to 1) choose different dates, 2) wait and hope that prices come down later, 3) transfer Amex Membership Rewards points to HawaiianMiles if you've got um, or 4) pay cash.",Kyo46,3,1dq78fu,na

But they always pull that crap, so I learned a lot time ago to just hang up before the Hilton person is connected. I'm sure Hilton pays Hawaiian for each referral, so they instruct the call center reps to just transfer you. 

I sincerely hope that if and when Alaska Air's purchase goes through, they transition call center services to their U.S.-based WFH representatives. I called during COVID and ended up having to wait on-hold for three hours, but despite being clearly overwhelmed, the rep that answer my call was genuinely friendly, competent, and very quickly and accurately addressed my needs.

Everyone else on the plane might not be as thrilled to see a baby board the plane, but that's their own problem. Anyway, just ask! I don't see them letting you bring the car seat, but people move around frequently on planes after take off. They may want you to stay where you are for weight distribution purposes during take off.

The above is for normals ops only. If the winds shift to what we call ""Kona winds,"" everything reverses. Aircraft will fly straight over Honolulu and land without double backing near Ko Olina, and will depart facing Ko Olina instead of Honolulu.

In even rarer circumstances, arriving flights will fly between Kaua'i and Oahu, turning towards Honolulu after passing Ka'ena Point. In this case, only those sitting on the left will have any view whatsoever.

Unfortunately, seat assignments are not guaranteed. But if you did pay for EC or a seat further forward and were not assigned to the same *type* of seat in the reshuffle, you would be owed the upgrade refund.

kyetcmq,2024-04-07 09:59:45,"You should see if Hawaiian violated any of its [Customer Service Plan](https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/about-us/customer-service-plan) or the [DOT Passenger Bill of Rights](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-cancellation-delay-dashboard?carrier_target_id=29841) when it comes to how the responded.

If you believe that they violated their customer service plan or DOT regulations, you should file a [DOT Complaint](https://secure.dot.gov/air-travel-complaint)

I think you mentioned they provided a meal voucher, and I believe you may have qualified for a hotel and/or ground transportation. Not sure though, because you were at your home airport. Also, the fact that you voluntarily rebooked to a later flight, not sure if that disqualifies you from getting your extra taxi ride from/to the airport reimbursed. Either way, save your receipts and submit for reimbursement.

Do you have any travel insurance? Either bought outright or through a travel credit card? If you did, some coverage may already be applicable. If not, probably a good idea to consider travel insurance in the future.

Regarding the gate agent’s handling of the situation, I agree that it’s not in line with how any customer service employee should behave. You should reach out to Hawaiian Airlines and submit an account of the situation so they can potentially follow up and correct the behavior. 

Not to excuse any of their behavior or how Tim missed some key details, in your opinion, but consider that they potentially have a plane of 200+ passengers who either want an update, need meal vouchers, want to switch to a different flight or anything other possibility. Also, it makes complete sense that they would not be concerned about your connecting flight OGG&gt;KOA because they probably don’t have any estimate as to when/if your PDX&gt;OGG plane will even get off the ground. If you were concerned about arriving in Kahului in the middle of the night and having to wait for a morning connecting flight, moving to the next confirmed flight is the right move.

Since you were willing to rebook to a later flight, I would suggest that as an alternate to waiting for the limited gate agents to help, you could call the reservations line to get rebooked. Best to get in line while simultaneously calling and waiting for a reservations agent, take help from whoever you get to first, whether on the phone or the gate agent.",Temporary_Cow_2340,6,1bxqrnb,na

llbvsjf,2024-09-04 00:45:09,And we should expect Southwest to do the same,ChequeOneTwoThree,3,1f7vcuj,na
llihwmp,2024-09-04 00:45:09,"Yep. These ""concerns"" have nothing to do with public interest. They're all about business interest. United profits off its codeshare agreement with Hawaiian, and Southwest wouldn't want a stronger competitor here.",Kyo46,1,1f7vcuj,llbvsjf
lldg23t,2024-09-04 05:45:11,"Tbh, this is the step in the right direction because the AS and HA merger shouldn’t happen. Sure HA would be bankrupt if the merger doesn’t go through but, they have been bankrupt before and will work on getting themselves out of it anyway. In my eyes, if this merger goes through, Southwest will be forced to leave the Hawaiian market and thus giving the monopoly back to Hawaiian on a silver platter, meaning higher prices for people to travel throughout the islands. It’s not good for consumers if you look at the overall picture because time after time, passengers have always looked for the lowest prices to go places. With this merger, it will raise prices and not make it affordable anymore for people to travel throughout the islands. On an even larger scale, look at the Canadian market for domestic travelers. There are Westjet and Air Canada. Due to Air Canada being on the East Coast and Westjet on the West coast, they can largely charge what they want for the flights they operate because there’s a lack of competition, similar to the inter island market in Hawaii.",One-Imagination-1230,3,1f7vcuj,na

llihm1k,2024-09-04 05:45:11,"If the merger goes through, Southwest won't be forced to leave Hawai'i. Despite what the media is reporting, Southwest sees Hawai'i as a long-term investment that will bring in additional profits to the carrier as a whole, even if their Hawai'i ops continues to lose money. However, they won't see the fruits of their efforts until, at minimum, they begin operating redeye flights are and able to issue itineraries from cities in the central and eastern U.S. - something they can't do right now. 

By the way, Southwest is a major reason why Hawaiian is facing bankruptcy today and why they won't survive going into the future. The pricing pressure Southwest is putting on Hawaiian (you know, the consumer good you're talking about) is partly why Hawaiian is hemoraging money. Hawaiian blames lack of Japanese demand, and that's certainly part of it. But, we could already see their finances getting stressed when Southwest began ops here back in 2019, too. 

If the merger fails, there just a couple things that can happen:

* **Private Equity:** the airline will be run into the ground by private equity firms after the squeeze as much value out of it that they can. One is attempting this with Southwest today (Elliot's turnaround pan for Southwest is pure stupidity), and another is trying this with JetBlue. 
* **Liquidation:** Hawaiian has no concrete strategy to return to sustainable profitability. How can it when a competitor like Southwest is systematically targeting Hawaiian's most profitable markets and is willing to take losses on them? In this case, Southwest gains a monopoly on inter-island flying. How's that better than the opposite. Moreover, the likelihood of an airline with the financial resources to acquire Hawaiian aside from Alaska getting regulatory approval to do so is slim. And in this case, Hawaiian will likely disappear and become part of that airline anyway. For example, if United were to acquire Hawaiian, they'd probably just be combined with their Micronesia operations since they have a lot of infrastructure here for that anyway. 

The intra-Hawai'i market is far different from the days of Aloha and Hawaiian. There's a lot of direct flights to Kaua'i, Maui, and Hawai'i Island, which lessens the need for inter-island flights. This plus the cost of operating inter-island flights make the business case difficult. There's reason to believe that the market can only handle a single carrier.",Kyo46,3,1f7vcuj,lldg23t
llx0qcu,2024-09-04 05:45:11,Not sure why people are rooting for thousands of people to lose their jobs by not wanting this merger so they can fly cheaper (which wouldn’t happen btw cause Southwest would raise prices with HA out of the way).,Original_Mammoth_967,1,1f7vcuj,lldg23t

lj3a9vv,2024-08-21 03:29:45,"I have a strong feeling that this merger is gonna have the same affect as when Alaska acquired Virgin America. Cut down flights, getting rid of all the Airbus aircraft, possibly significantly reducing the amount of flights from Hawaii to Asia and Oceania, will lay off the ground staff which are unionized as soon as their agreement to keep the staff is over, lowering prices to undercut SW from competing in Hawaii basically forcing them out of the inter island market.

I like Alaska Airlines but, something like this is bound to happen eventually if the DOT approves the merger. Just take a look at what happened with Virgin America. There are less nonstops in SFO, LAX and SAN on Alaska because they decided to consolidate everything in Seattle instead.

This time around it is for growth, since organic growth is basically impossible due to aircraft deliveries. A big focus on that growth is the widebody aircraft and international structure/expertise HA has already built. I don’t expect to see any downsizing there. Interisland flying may be on the chopping block and I’ll bet dollars to do its that was one of the DOJs big concerns.

The VX Airbuses were leased on really shitty terms which is why Alaska was so keen to ditch them. The Hawaiian buses are a whole different story and there seems to be no rush to offload them, despite the proudly all Boeing nose art.",Longwaytofall,2,1ewnyyz,lj3a9vv

We still had our tickets to go to the Oregon, showing first class w get up to the counter. We have no reservation for you. Apparently they changed the fight. Didn't tell us about it, then after much. Scrambling they did put us up for a night the next day. They flew us back by coach but had taken all our miles. We just now got them back. Except they took part of our miles for coach tickets. And just the other day they offered to give us two $400 vouchers but has to be used up within the year while we hadn't planned on going back to Hawaii. So now what do we do?

mai tai’s the whole way included in your tickets. Starlink has been a real big game changer for us and you’ll enjoy it immensely. Since the seats are 2x2x2 I think getting sitting in row 2 and 3 are probably best, I like 4A the most as a preference. The first class flight attendants are very very sweet and will provide you guys great service. If you do continue with your seats of 2A/B and 3A/B then on your way into Oahu (assuming flt is to HNL) you will be able to see a great view of west coast and central Oahu during landing, you also might get to see big island on your way in. If you seat 2E/F Then you’ll see Maui and most of the east coast/waikiki  on your way in before turning into pattern for landing.

I didn't and read all the stuff on the card which basically told me that I must book directly with Hawaiian and used my card to pay for it.  So I did just that but got billed regular price.  Called the card and they said ""Did you use the coupon code?"", which I replied ""What coupon code?"".  That's when I learned about the coupon code and by then they said it was too late.  It took several calls and a lot of bitching to finally get the discount.

Still pissed about how they handled that and how many points it took to buy my son his ticket.  The 70k miles might be good enough for 4 one-way tickets at some point of the year but it's not even close to enough for two round trips during the summer.

ljnt5fi,2024-08-24 12:49:05,"Flew from Haneda to Honolulu maybe a month ago. If you get there super early the Hawaiian Airlines desk won't even be open; that said, the airport has plenty to check out and keep you occupied. If, for example, you have someone in your ohana that was really hoping for canned bread, there's a flight-centric gift shop in there that has some. Otherwise it's kind of hard to find. Anyway, there's a full-up shopping mall, and as long as you don't have too many bags to tote around it won't be a problem. Good time to use up any last credit on your welcome Suica card.

Pay attention to when the check-in does start. You want to get in line before that happens. The line will get huge, and wrap twice around the desk; it moves, it just takes forever. You might as well be one of those people that gets through the line quickly and then has extra time once you get through security. Otherwise, you'll get through security, walk super far to the gate, and have maybe half an hour before it's time to board. Either way you aren't likely to be cruising the pre-security area without having to deal with your bags.

Pay attention to which line you get into at the check-in desk. They will be marked with the flight number; getting into the wrong line won't help you, because it won't be moving.",lanclos,5,1ezupqs,na

ljp5t61,2024-08-24 21:03:00,"In my experience it depends on the airline’s presence at the airport. If you were flying from the airline’s hub you could check in that early (but HNL is not a great airport for a long layover), but at an airport where the airline only has one or two flights per day, the ticket counter won’t normally open until 3 hours before departure, which Hawaiian Airlines advises is the case for Haneda. So if you are hoping to check your bags early and do things in the airport, that likely won’t be possible. I recommend asking the hotel to hold your bags, do stuff in the town, then travel to the airport in time to check in three hours before your flight. You can check in online 24 hours ahead.",MatthewnPDX,1,1ezupqs,na

It may have also helped that I am pualani platinum, but I assure you it's technically possible, regardless of they are willing to extend the same courtesy.

Obviously, they will only do this if you have enough miles already to cover any fare difference, and you won't be able to book anything else with miles while your account is negative.

ksdvltl,2024-02-27 23:18:29,"Not sure if this helps, but after some years of trying different angles - this is how I do it now:

FC pricing and point redemption varies wildly if booked directly online.  However, upgrading Main Cabin is always 25,000 miles each way per seat.

So for two tickets I find my desired flight and FC availability (must have open lay down seats).  

IMPORTANT STEP: Contact HA by phone and let them know the flights and ask if FC upgrades are available for those flights at 25,000 miles.  Once they confirm, book the MC seats with them still on the phone and provide them confirmation code.  They will do the upgrade while your on the phone.

Bottom line is two round trips FC for MC fare plus 100,000.  

Maybe this works for you?  For us it always takes away the wondering about fluctuations in pricing and point redemption.  It's just always 25,000 no matter what the pricing is doing on the HA web site.

We got blanket and pillow in extra comfort.  Blankets were useful.  Two snacks one small meal-options for us were rice or pasta.  Pasta was thumbs down per family rice was fine.  Drinks were offered a few times plus they offer water which is nice, but I like to bring empty water bottle, then fill up after security so you have your own.  Between about hour 3 or 4 to 5 or 6 of the flight, everyone seemed to have windows down and it was dark for a while, so if planning a nap mid flight probably best.

Row 14 has no under seat, so everything has to go in overhead bin.

kz75fx9,2024-04-12 14:40:16,"Save for what happened on April 6 &amp; 7, every flight PDX-OGG has flown and been on time. 8th, 9th, 10th, today, have been fine, and the plane for tomorrow’s flight has already arrived in PDX tonight.

My best guess of what happened on April 6 (which arrived the night of April 5) is that the plane required maintenance upon arrival in PDX which caused it to fly out late on April 7 instead so it could be repaired. Being that PDX is not a Hawaiian hub, contracting maintenance might have been more difficult. Also, since it’s not a hub, there’s no extra aircraft to switch out, resulting in long delays.

If you’re interested in tracking your inbound plane, it looks like plane N212HA is already assigned to your Saturday flight. You can track the plane’s flights leading up to yours on something like [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n212ha#) Note: it’s still a few days out, the assigned aircraft could change.

lnx7gm5,2024-09-20 00:53:08,"The companion pass is not that great a perk.

Alaska and Hawaiian are merging mileage programs next year. If you are able, just start getting credit cards to load up on Alaska and Hawaiian miles, and they’ll combine next year.

A different arbitrage you can do, Alaska basic fares earn 30% miles towards status, while Hawaiian earn 100%. So it’s possible to earn Hawaiian status buying very cheap fares. I estimate $1300 for 4x RT tickets HNL-SFO, and that gets you status.

Because Hawaiian is a destination airline, much of the program is aimed at people who come to hawaii on vacation every year. If you live here, and can fly Hawaiian a few times between the mainland each year, you can get status, where you would need to fly 3x more, or purchase more expensive tickets, with Alaska.


Basically, Alaska miles are ‘worth’ more but Hawaiian is more generous with them. Earn as many Hawaiian points as you can, and earn status while you can, so it transfers into Alaska. Moving to Alaska now is the wrong move.",ChequeOneTwoThree,3,1fkj20g,na

lq1kcu5,2024-10-03 05:36:45,"I am a long time alaska card holder and my family have multiple business and personal cards that allows me 4 companion pass per year. 

We always use the companion pass and generally happy about it. 

What i learnt is the best usage is to fly to hawaii, mexico, bermuda, basically long haul flights at peak season. We just bought SEA-CUN for new year 2025 trip and that flight would have cost us $800 per person. After using companion cert, the second person only pays $267. So after factoring the annual credit card fees, we are still up $500+

There are some years where we can’t maximize the companion cert value. So we typically use it for a short haul flights such as SEA-LAX or SEA-LAS. Normally we barely breakeven after factoring the annual card fees, but we just shrug it off. It just means we havent maximized the companion pass value. 

I am particularly excited with the hawaiian addition especially as it opens more pacific routes. I doubt alaska would allow use of the companion pass for those routes (errm: Delta), but if they do, i’d probably open more alaska credit cards 😉",err-reddit,1,1fkj20g,na

They made a drastic change to the dates on a ticket I booked next March. The new change doesn't work with my vacation schedule, and apparently, there is an Alaska / Hawaiian flight combo instead of a complete Hawaiian flight where I am flying from. I called them to tell them I would like to keep my original flight time even though it's now operated on Alaska / Hawaiian. They kept offering me earlier dates than my vacation time, which they mentioned were flights operated only by Hawaiian. I mentioned I could not fly earlier than the date I booked.

I then mentioned I would be open to flying on a partner airline since it is mentioned on their website they can do that. They wouldn't budge, and they wouldn't book me on the Alaska / Hawaiian flight combo either. I kept mentioning the flight change was their doing, and they would need to reschedule me on a flight that works for me.

Both of the CS agents at the end said, ""You can just cancel your flight."" 😒

Obviously, A class awards are harder to find than P class awards.  Other than using a paid subscription like ExpertFlyer to check A and P class for your flight, the only other way to know for sure is to call Hawaiian or chat with an agent on the website.  I’ve noticed JFK during off peak travel times is easier to find A class availability than BOS.  So depends on where you’re traveling from.  Hawaiian is otherwise pretty generous with releasing A class availability for West Coast flights to the islands.",twosli,3,1dv8q21,na

My preferred method for getting HA 1st class is outright at booking through Virgin Atlantic on D fares.  You have to verify partner availability for D fare code seats (again through Expert Flyer, or JetBlue but that’s a painful alternative).  Then using transferrable credit card points (Amex, Chase, Citi, Cap1, etc) convert those to Virgin Red Points.  Call Virgin with the flight information and book over the phone.  This is the best method for me since there are nearly perpetual transfer bonuses with Virgin Atlantic of 20-30% extra.  So those 1st class flights end up costing only 31,000 points many times.

In the past they were great and I prefer a direct route rather than a west coast connection as I don't fly AA who does a direct service to Hnl.  When any changes are made for any flights (either I made the change or airline made the change).  They don't charge a change fee but ALWAYS charge a fare difference.  Even first class isn't an even exchange.   It really is frustrating when an airline has only one flight daily and that flight is cancelled. Therefore, I no longer fly with HA outside of the islands.   I made an exception and flew to Vegas with Hawaiian in December.  Fortunately that went off without incident.  If this happened to me, I would make a complaint.  Send a complaint to everyone and don't settle for the 2500 miles. 

Also, the HA card isn't very good outside of free bags.  The Amex Platinum has an exceptional card  as well as the Chase Sapphire Reserve with many travel benefits including lounge and insurance to name a few.   If you travel a bunch interisland than the free bag benefit is useful for the HA card.  Otherwise, I don't use the card.

llmjy8a,2024-09-05 21:28:46,"&gt; do their own itinerary and do Hawaiian air and transfer to a difffent airline to get to Europe?

Yes, sort of. But it’s not a good idea. I have family in the Bay Area, so when I have gone to Europe so far this year, I’ve flown Hawaiian HNL-SFO, then spent a few days with family, before flying United SFO-Europe. This only makes sense because I want to spend time in SFO.

The Hawaiian flight + the United flight is much more expensive than if I had booked from HNL to Europe on a single ticket with United.

Next year I’m going to Spain, by fling Hawaiian to JFK and then AA from there. This only made sense because I had an award ticket on AA. But to feel comfortable doing this, I’m landing at JFK 28 hours before my flight to Spain, and staying in the hotel at JFK for a night.

Doing your own itinerary really only works if you can be very flexible. If book Hawaiian to the mainland, and then a different carrier to Europe, and your Hawaiian flight gets delayed or cancelled, you will miss your Europe flight and they won’t put you on the next one because you no-showed. You also have to leave security, pick up your bags, and then check them again. No interline on a different tickets.",ChequeOneTwoThree,6,1f9gjy3,na

I also attempted to find a different itinerary by booking Hawaiian Flights to the mainland (or Asia), but settled on the price and convenience of one booking.  
If I did it again, I would probably fly Hawaiian to the east coast and any other airline to Europe, at least the JFK and Boston flights arrive in the AM, giving you some options (if everything goes well).

We’re in a really, really good spot for split bookings. You want to find a Hawaiian flight to somewhere in SE Asia, and then a Finnair flight from there to Helsinki, connecting to Europe.

Finnair lost most of their revenue when Russian airspace was closed, so they’re running all sorts of flights from Helsinki to popular destinations in SE Asia, so you can take an unpopular Hawaiian flight Asia and then an unpopular Finnair flight to Europe.",ChequeOneTwoThree,1,1f9gjy3,lloiyzd

The chance is as close to zero as you can get, without being zero. 

The Department of Transportation told airlines they should do everything possible to seat children next to adults, and most airlines are treating this like a rule. For example, United now allows adults to pick seats next to children, even on their Basic Economy fares which normally do not allow seat selection at all.
