0,absdf,2019-08-03 11:27:29,中国产C919飞机有一大缺点 难获国际市场,中国C919飞机原定于去年年底交付。虽然在今年5月完成了即将交付用户的首架飞机的试飞，但还没有确定交付日期。该飞机由中国企中国商飞公司（Comac）开发。C919吸引力不够 将无法与波音和空客争夺国际市场目前，全球航空公司对于在何处购买客机几乎没有什么选择。大型民用飞机的全球市场由两家公司主导：美国波音公司和欧洲空客公司。根据航空中心的数据，中国将成为世界上最大的航空旅行市场，并拥有248个运营机场。中国商飞的目标是到2035年控制中国国内大型飞机市场的三分之一。《金融时报》报导，贝恩策略顾问公司（Bain & Company）航空航天和国防业务负责人吉姆·哈里斯（Jim Harris）表示，中共政府愿意投资数百亿美元来实现让C919替代波音或空客在国内的市场。即使C919的竞争力不如西方的替代品，中共政府也可以授权给中国商飞订单。根据中国商飞的网站，到目前为止，该公司已经收到了来自28家客户815架的订单，价值5000亿人民币（740亿美元）。《金融时报》说，据信买家几乎都来自中国国内的航空公司，如中国东方航空公司和深圳航空公司。然而，对于全球市场，业内人士表示，168座的C919没有那么大的竞争力，因为它的燃油效率不如波音和空客的飞机，将很难把国际买家从这两家飞机制造巨头那里吸引过来。空客表示，尽管它预计中国国内需求的“某些部分”将由C919飞机来满足，但在国际上，中国商飞缺乏对空客和波音双头垄断构成威胁的基础设施和投资。空客说，为了取得更广泛的市场成功，中国商飞还需要'一个国际销售团体以及一个成熟的客户支持网络。事实上，空客花了大约40年的时间才实现与美国制造商的均衡'。,xl,0,0,SouthwestAirlines,WN,NEUTRAL

Once inside the airport, I went to the kiosk to check in.  It still showed my original flight & boarding position, but when my baggage tags printed, they were already adjusted to the standby flight.  Questions:  
  
1.  Did the tags print like this because the standby flight showed 85 seats available, so the system ""assumed"" (due to some algorithm) that I would easily make that flight **\*OR\*** is that standard procedure to ensure that even if YOU don't make the flight, your bags will be waiting at your destination when you arrive?  
  
2.  If the latter scenario occurs (bags get on standby flight, but you don't), do the baggage handlers at destination airport get alerted somehow to place luggage directly with the baggage service desk?  I feel a bit uneasy about my unclaimed bags going around & around the carousel, appearing abandoned and ripe for the taking!

12,1g7i65v,2024-10-20 04:40:30,Companion Pass - just looking for confirmation,"So, I'm new to the whole points/miles/credit card bonuses thing.  Quick rundown: 

* Started flying for work this year, racked up miles on Southwest. 
* Heard about Companion Pass, saw the $3,000/85,000 miles SW credit card offer. Common story.  
* Didn't fully grasp the details behind best timing to complete the spend/receive the bonus... Mistake! Maybe? Signed up on September 19th. 
   * 'New Account Bonus' section in credit card app says 'Spend $$$$by Dec 20, 2024 to earn 85,000 bonus rewards.""

A couple questions:

1. Did I for sure screw up the possibility of 2025/2026 CP with this signup date?
   * If yes, I assume my best course is to complete my spend ASAP to qualify for CP as soon as possible.  BUT - card fine print says 'possible 6-8 weeks' for delivery of bonus to my account.
2. What has been your experience in terms of wait time to receive the card bonus?
   * If I complete spend by end of next billing cycle (11/20) and the bonus takes 8 weeks to post to my account (so, in 2025), does that mean that the miles would then count for the 2025 calendar year, or would they somehow 'postdate' to this year because they were earned then?
   * Or, should I slow my roll on the spend and close out the full 3 months if points actually take 8 weeks to arrive and count toward the year that they appear?

Either way, I'm fine with it, CP still seems like a great bonus so 1 year/2 years, it's pretty cool either way.  Just wish I would have researched a bit more beforehand and done a better job making sure I maximized it.

Thanks in advance for any insights. 

TLDR;

Points/miles newbie, signed up for a SW credit card for bonus miles in September, curious if posting date of credit card bonus will for sure be in 2025 or possibility of 2024 if card bonus actually takes 8 weeks.

A couple months ago I booked my flights for the holidays but now that itinerary doesn't show up when I do a new search for flights. Has anyone had issues with this before?
My account still shows that I'm booked on my original itinerary and when calling SW, they confirmed the flights still exist and I'm booked on them. But, I occasionally look at the flights I booked to see if the price changed and now the itinerary I'm booked on doesn't show up if I were to try and book it now. It's an itinerary with 2 flights, so looking from city A to city C, it's not there but looking from A to B and B to C, the flights are available.
Maybe I'm being paranoid because I had an issue with a flight recently where they had to change my itinerary when I got to the airport because one of my flight numbers didn't exist (and they didn't give me any notice except to talk to an agent when I went to check in 24hrs before my flight).

I have not flown Southwest in a while and I have a 1 year old who will be traveling for the first time. 

I wanted her to have her own seat and used by companion pass.

I called SWA and several agents told me it all depends on the agent at the gate if they'll let my 1 year old board with us in the A1-15 group. 

I downgraded both of our  tickets to wanna get away to get the points back and will just board with family boarding, which will be before Group B-this  will still be able to ensure we all sit together.

Im fairly confident on how to time the $3000 spending to get the 85000 in January 2025. If I’m correct I have to pass the $3000 threshold AFTER my December closing date so that the points hit AFTER my January closing date. (Please feel free to correct me if Im wrong)

Now to what I need help with. Im planning a trip for the 3rd weekend of January, round trip through Southwest and also using the Southwest hotels for extra points towards companion pass. Basically it would be around 7500 extra points that would count towards CP. My question is, when would those 7500ish points hit? Would they be posted after this next closing date if i pay for it now?

62,1g5ckrh,2024-10-17 06:58:49,Another example of an antiquated system or a company unwilling to perform as promised?,"I unfortunately had to evacuate due to hurricane Milton. I had changed my flight time twice due to the fear of the airport possibly closing.   The airport then announces that they were closing the day that I was scheduled to fly out, so I booked my new flight as quickly as I could on the app, with my SW card, as there were only three seats left. Because I already had a flight booked with a credit, I called into customer service to have everything changed around. I was told that they couldn’t book my new flight with the credit because it was the same day and they didn’t have info the airport was closing, but to call back afterwards to get everything corrected.

 After rushing to pack, dealing with an in-law, as well as drugging up a dog and a cat to get them in carriers (which they have never done) the stress level was at a nine. Get the flight out, land, deal with the ATL airport busyness, hour at the rental car place, and finally into the hotel room. I called back and was told I had to write in because it wasn’t something they could do on the phone. Fine, I do so, taking almost an hour to document all the prior flight times, amounts, numbers, etc. 

I just received a phone call and was told that I am out of luck and I will ultimately be charged over $400 on my credit card for a one-way, 1.5 hour flight and they are not able to use my prior credit or points, even though the agent on the phone told me they absolutely would do so. The most disrespectful statement was that I agreed to terms and conditions when I bought the tickets so I should’ve known that it wouldn’t be corrected. 

What that means is that you are no longer able to go by the word of an employee at a company, but instead need to read the small print or you will be screwed.
I was offered $100 voucher, but this is the third issue with incorrect information. No longer is Southwest a customer service oriented value company, as the flights aren’t much cheaper than most others.

I travel with wife and/or kid at least once a month and our airports are somewhat more expensive than big hubs.

The bad part is they won't cover early bird, which I always get for personal travel because I need an aisle seat. I just checked the early bird option and it's $30 each way! Has anyone found this price before? I've never paid more than $20 each way, and this would be $60 out of pocket for a work trip, so I'm hesitant to shell out the bucks for it. 

I used to get medical preboard because I have a tendency toward blood clots and need an aisle seat to make sure I can get up and walk around. That's mostly under control with medication, so I stopped the medical pre-board because I was tired of the stink eye from other passengers as well as the gate agents who grilled me about my medical needs even though I had a legit condition. I still need the aisle seat because I have sciatica and get claustrophobic in middle or window seats, so I started doing early bird to ensure I got a seat that worked for me. So for this trip, should I brave the stink eye and do medical pre-board (blood clots are still a thing, and it's a 4-hour flight), suck it up and pay the $60, or do the 24 hour check-in and hope for a good boarding position?

Just a couple rows.  Even Spirit of all airlines offers it at this point.  They call it ""big front seat"" which is smart branding because you know it is a bigger nicer seat but it is very much not ""first class"" and you are still on Spirit.  Your expectations are set accordingly.

Right now Southwest ""business"" ticket is pretty lackluster and the only noteable advantage at quite extreme price premium is boarding early but with assigned seats that matters a lot less.  Southwest needs something.  

Put four rows of 2+2 up front in the same space as 5 rows of 3+3.  That reduces seat count by 14 (16 seats in the place of 30 now) and requires tickets be 80% more.  I would gladly pay a 80% premium over Southwest discount rates for a ""first class"" sized seat, earliest boarding, free booze/wifi, dedicated bins, extra points/miles, etc.  I know I can't be the only one.  We use to fly SW when younger and switched to Delta.  However in the last couple years Delta has gotten insane with rising price and falling service.

They stated that they would not. 

Has anyone had this happen? I've called a few times and they said they won't work with me because it was their partner airlines fault.

163,1dlytjy,2024-06-22 23:56:50,Dissatisfied,"I have been flying American Airlines solely for about 20 years. But have noticed a shift in their policies, processes, and customer satisfaction. 

1.They refuse to return a travel credit of $525 that we were forced to cancel the ticket and rebook due to a glitch at booking in their system. The credit expired and per their policy cannot be re-instated under any circumstances. There was never a prompt or reminder that this credit was coming to expiration. The one time I tried to apply the credit to a booking flying to London, the system had a ""glitch"" and I was not able to apply. I see a recurring theme here. 

2. Their call centers are overseas and the reps are never able to resolve any issue. Their only response to a request is a standard ""NO"". No matter what the circumstance, usually some error with the app or website. Requesting to speak with an agent here in the US, am told they are unable to transfer me. I make the request because I usually have better luck. 

3. I opened an American Airlines Executive Mastercard with a promotion offer of 40k miles and $200 statement credit for spending $5k within 90 days which I met the requirement and never recieved the credit. I have made several attempts to resolve, they simply will not honor the offer. 

4. I have 5 vouchers for seat upgrades that I have attempted to use multiple times at booking but the app/website never gives you the option to apply at booking. These may only be applied at time of booking and I have never been able to use them. Calling in you hold for 45 minutes and then their agents say there is nothing they can do because I have already completed the booking. 

5. They email your offers for rental cars and such. I've tried twice to book one of these offers and both times when I went to pick up the rental, the company had nothing in their system for the reservation. Even though I was able to show them proof of booking and the special price... both times I was told they did not have that price available. The Advantage Desk was no help as they were not open to assist and no other department could help.

My bag is from Nordstrom and it was around $350 but they’re only trying to give me $125. Their website says they cover up to $3800 if it’s a domestic flight and I provide everything they need but now they want a receipt which I do not have because the luggage was a gift.

I’ve had the worst time with my case owner, she has terrible communication and I have not been able to get a hold of her.

I asked the gate agent if there were enough empty seats  for me to have a complimentary car seat seat. The gate agent said sure no problem and I’ll also give you a whole row to yourself. Anyways I’m situated with my daughter in her car seat (she’s 1 and I’m flying alone with her) and a different gate agent comes up and says “you’ll need to check that” and I was like “oh actually the gate agent told me I could use it for my car seat I asked her before the flight” and she said “no you can’t you didn’t pay for the seat. I was like what does that matter if it’s empty anyways? And she goes you didn’t pay for it and you can’t use it. I’ll give you a minute to get situated  and come back for it. I decided not to make a scene and try to enjoy the rest of my flight but my car seat fits in the overhead compartment so I put it up there (again this is a virtually empty flight  so there was no shortage of bin space). She comes back and says, exactly like this,  “get your car seat out for me”. And I said so now it can’t be in the overhead bin? And she goes no because you didn’t pay for it. Holding my 1 year old I open it up and she goes “get it out for me”. Wtf???! I’m holding my baby!?!? Anyways the lady behind me goes that’s enough you’re just being nasty now and gets it down for me. 

My question is - is this a legitimate thing? I would understand if maybe there was some sort of liability thing related to the usage of the seat? But I have done this same thing on empty southwest flights with no problem. Despite that, there’s no reason I couldn’t put my car seat in the overhead compartment.

I know losing things is my fault, so I didn’t expect anything much. But as a diehard Delta fan, I’m always reading about their constant innovations and love the lounges, so I was expecting more from how their lost and found operation would be.  
  
I filled out their online form, which was pretty horrible and long, and was never really contacted or kept updated after that.  
  
The item I lost was trackable so I was very puzzled to see it bounce back and forth from where I had initially lost it at my arrival destination to an address in Scottsboro, AL. Only after calling and trying to inquire did I find out it was some store called Unclaimed Baggage where they ship items too first.  
  
I thought my item had definitely been stolen or something, as the fact that my item was being sent to a place thousands of miles from where I lost it wasn’t communicated to me at all. In fact, I needed my item for work, so it became a tense situation for me to be kept in the dark for so long. I would have rather been told it was just lost or stolen for good so I could have gone about my business rather than wait so many days wondering why my item kept traveling from one place to another.  
  
I’m glad they have some process in place, but keeping customers in the dark for weeks at a time seems so unlike Delta. Finally after a bit of time of my item being in Scottsboro, AL I got an email saying my item was found and I had to pay an exorbitant amount in shipping to get it back.  
  
I hope Delta improves this because I’m sure this is a tense and frustrating experience for so many of their passengers.

I’ve been checking my Delta profile certificates section daily since then to ensure that the companion certificate has been issued, which has not been issued. I reached out to Delta about two weeks ago and they told me that August and September 2024 companion certificates have not been issued due to a technical issue with Amex. 

Still without a companion certificate nearly a month after the renewal,  I reached out to Amex this evening. They finally confirmed, after going back and forth with a frontline CS agent and a supervisor—when I asked if they have not issued certificates for August and September renewals, the supervisor confirmed that they have not issued July, August, or September certificates. 

I asked why there has not been a communication to customers about the issue and shouldn’t there be compensation in the form of renewal extensions due to the inability to use the greatest value benefit, in my opinion, of the Delta Reserve card. He said those were valid points and would elevate them and to check back in a week.

232,1fovj5f,2024-09-25 11:47:59,I have never been so disappointed with an airline service as much as I am now with Delta,"I have spent from 4:10 PM until now just rebooking my family's flights.  The sad part is that I have tried over and over again to do it as I usually do, to self-serve; however, over and over again, the system is failing and giving error messages.  True enough, I started to seek customer service assistance through chat.  Nothing.  They cannot answer the most straightforward questions and cannot help one bit.  I had issues even timing flights and was confused between AM and PM.  I already gave out all the flight details. Still, they were confused.  I gave up and decided to call.  Lo and behold 52 minutes wait time.  

  
That's not the icing on top, though. After a gruelling six or so hours, I then had to download all my receipts because, of course, I had swallowed all the fare differences amounting to over 2K USD, even if the flights I took were already flexible dates but with fare difference charges. Fair enough. But to top it all off, I cannot download my itinerary even if it's showing me on my app the changes made.  

  
Much to my dismay, i chatted with an associate again.  She was sweet.  Recognised the issue immediately.  She recognized it was an error in the system.  Of course, having spent the amount of time I spent.  And rightfully so.  All of the transactions have been pending in my account, and I received charges on my AMEX card.  Then gets transferred to the next agent.  Because of course, somebody had to do it, so I had to be transferred again.  After reviewing my case again for another 20 or so minutes.  I waited and finally got a response back from the agent saying, sorry, ""I can't waive any charges for you because we can see it processed; however, the ticket wasn't issued, meaning it will only be on hold until such time, and then it will drop.  If you want to secure your flights, I must reprocess and recharge you.  I guess the frustrating part is that there is no effort at all to make things right.  Do this or lose your flights.  I told them I booked my family on a separate booking, so I had no choice.   The response to me was almost insulting, just saying, well, can you give me the confirmation code of your family?  It's just.... frustrating.  My point here is that there is no amount of effort that they can give my time back, but also the frustration their system brought, and to top it off, double charge you, and you know, it should fall off in the next couple or so days.  

  
The lack of empathy is an understatement of frustration for me. I also requested some logs, etc., because even the pricing on the website is wrong with what they are telling me on the phone. This is clearly a BBB issue, but the only thing I have is here's a link to file your complaint.  

  
I have been a Medallion member since 2010. I have my Delta rewards card for AMEX even if I have never used the travel companion certificate because, of course, fare restrictions on classes are just a nice touch of F\*\*\* Y\*\* for thinking you can use it.

Hear me out - I know it’s a silly problem but I feel slighted because I didn’t get what I paid for: 

I paid $3828 for a one-way business class ticket for a 9 hour cross-Atlantic flight.  When I was entering the plane a mechanics tells me my seat had a little problem. It couldn’t recline completely but it would be ok. Turns out, my seat could not be moved at all. I asked to be moved even to economy class but they said it was a full flight. I was sitting straight up for the duration of the flight and not sleeping as I had expected. I assumed I would be reimbursed for at least 75% of the cost (the difference between an economy and business class seat) but ended up with $210 in skymiles. What a grotesque lack of costumer service.

So we booked a connecting flight with Philippine Airlines (MNL to TPE) and Delta Air (TPE to SEA). All were going well, we’re already seated inside the plane and my was in the cargo already - not until a cabin crew approached us and told us that Delta said they cannot accept our dog for the available aircraft they have for our next flight. That they can just accept a service dog which is not applicable to my dog. PAL crew asked us right on the spot if we want to take this flight and just leave our dog or get off the plane (in a nice way btw) so we had no choice but to just get off the plane because who the hell will leave her dog, right???

We called Delta air and asked what happened, what’s their solution. They booked us for another flight the next day (earliest they can book us), same time - EVA + Delta. We went back home.

The next day, we arrived in the airport and headed to EVA for check in. The crew said they cannot accept our dog because we only have US import permit and not Taiwan permit. So we were so confused because we never had an issue with PAL about Taiwan permit even we have the same route???

I researched about it online and found out it needs to be requested atleast 20days before the flight.

And also, we were so mad at this point because why would Delta/PAL rebooked us to that flight without considering that, right?! EVA crew also said that we need to also secure a pet reservation 48hrs prior the flight itself which is impossible because ours was just rebooked yesterday.

My dog got stressed really bad as she’s not used to being caged for so long so we decided to sent her back home to my family. And that means we will need to reprocess all the things we did to get her permit and pay more because we will be flying her under new rule soon.

Delta rebooked the flight and we had to wait 6hrs in the airport to take that flight. My fiancè had to missed 1 day of his work because he couldnt make it on time for work due to delays happened.

I’m a Delta Platinum Medallion member and booked a flight directly with KLM for an upcoming trip. It’s just two of us on the itinerary. Initially, after I booked, I called and the representative chose our seats at no charge — didn’t ask for it and just assumed it was because of the status. 

A few days later, due to a change in the itinerary, we had to reselect our seats, and now I’m being asked to pay for my companion. I explained that we didn’t need to pay the original flight. The representative was able to confirm that the previous seats were free and was confused why. She placed me on hold and after 45 minutes, was able to change the seats back with her supervisors help.

I started a chat with KLM so I can share the screenshots but figured someone here might have the experience and could help clarify.

A member of our Care team member will be with you shortly.""

That was three hours ago. I haven't heard from anyone in the chat since then. In the meantime I filled out their complaint form at the bottom of their website and got an almost immediate response apologizing for the wait and including a $50 flight credit.

Exceptional Customer Service: From the check-in process to the in-flight experience, the Delta staff was incredibly helpful and friendly.

Comfortable Seating: Even in economy class, the seats were more comfortable than what I’ve experienced with other airlines.

Punctuality: Both of my flights were on time, which is a huge plus given the frequent delays in the industry.

Entertainment: The selection of movies, TV shows, and music was impressive and helped the flight pass by quickly.

Cleanliness: The plane was spotless.

This morning, I witnessed something truly special that I wanted to share. Amidst what has been probably one of the most stressful weeks for airlines since 2001, our flight DL2571 was fully booked and 80% boarded. Just ten minutes before departure, our pilot stepped off the plane and walked through a full jetway of 40 people, down the jetway zig-zagging down the ramp. He approached a mother and her probably three-year-old son, who was visibly overwhelmed by the whole boarding process.

In a gesture that went above and beyond, the pilot reached into his pocket and handed the young boy a pair of wings and a playing card sitting with him at his level talking about the flight. This small act of kindness captured the boy’s attention and helped alleviate his fear long enough for the pilot and  his mom to get him settled on the plane which she has done flawlessly. Thanks to the pilot’s thoughtful actions, we had an on-time departure and the flight is going great.

It was a touching moment to witness at 5 in the morning. Seeing the pilot go out of his way to help, and the young boy bravely overcoming his fear, was a beautiful reminder that moments of kindness and unity can still happen in the divisive, negative world we live in.

Kudos to the mom for her efforts, and a big thank you to the pilot for making such a difference. The young boy can now proudly say he has flown as a co-pilot!",Due-Principle9044,21,77,DeltaAirlines,DL,NEGATIVE

332,1g2md8h,2024-10-13 18:04:23,"Our Surreal Incident with Hawaiian Airlines (Oct 11th, SAN-HNL)","Hi everyone, I'm writing this because I just felt like it'd be cathartic to write about my family and my experiences these past couple of days.

On Oct. 11th, 2024, my family and I (2 adults and 1 almost toddler), took off from San Diego, on Hawaiian Airlines, headed for Oahu. We had planned on being in Hawaii for about 3 days on a short vacation during this holiday weekend.

About an hour and half into our flight, the flight crew announced to us the unfortunate news that our plane would have to return to San Diego due to mechanical issues they were not able to resolve. They assured us that the issue was not detrimental to the integrity of the plane, but did not elaborate any further.

My wife and I were frustrated, but we figured it was for the best, because we didn't want to be flying on a plane that had unresolved mechanical issues. We figured they'd land and, possibly, transfer us into a different flight or fix the mechanical issue. At the very least, we'd be back in San Diego and probably have to go home.

About 45 minutes into the flight back, the flight crew announced that we were rerouted to Oakland International airport instead by some managing staff. That's when my wife and I started to get worried. We were hopeful that the airline would figure things out, but it looked less and less likely that we'd make it to Hawaii that same day. Plus, we'd now be stuck in Oakland with our baby and not knowing what the airline planned.

Our fears were confirmed about 40 minutes after we had landed and all the passengers had been kept on the airplane (but allowed to stand and stretch): the crew had to be relieved due to reaching the limits of their work time and there was no other flights and crews available to fly us out from Oakland. The manager on duty figured that the soonest we could get on another flight out would be the next day at 8 am. There would be accommodations provided, but everyone would have to line up to get them (while the airplanes luggage was being unloaded).

To make matters worse, we heard from several of the Hawaiian Airlines staff (including an announcement from the manager) that the mechanical failure was due to a heating element malfunctioning in the cargo area of the plane and that an animal in that area had to be checked on. Ultimately, we found out that animal was a dog. The whole flight of 400+ people was diverted and cancelled because of one (1) pet dog.

Based on the information we had at the time on the plane, my wife and I decided to cancel our trip and try to recoup our money. That process included: contacting Costco Travel and cancelling our travel package, calling Hawaiian Airlines to get a refund, and figuring how we'd get home from Oakland.

Costco Travel was, surprisingly, the easiest part of the process to cancel our trip. We explained our situation and they offered to refund us, understandably, with a loss of $300 for one day of accomodations. We were advised to contact our credit card to see if travel insurance could cover the remaining losses.

As we waited in line to get a hotel room, my wife called the Hawaiian Airlines customer service to request for a refund. The customer service staff initially offered a ""refund"" but wasn't willing to clearly state for how much, instead telling my wife she'd be notified after a decision was made by phone or email.

After the roundabout explanation and lack of assurances, the staff person asked if my wife accepted the terms. This upset my wife and she refused to accept their offer. Pressing for clarity, the staff person finally relented and explained that only half of our ticket costs would be refunded because we had already utilized half the cost of the round-trip tickets by flying with Hawaiian Airlines.

The terms offered were unacceptable to my wife, and she asked for a manager. (I am very appreciative of her calm under stressful circumstances, because I would have been intolerable.) Eventually, she spoke to the manager, explained our situation about being stranded in a random city with a baby, and the manager agreed to a full refund.

As for getting home, the Hawaiian Airlines customer service manager said they could not provide for us flights home, due to something related to the Alaska Airlines merger. They suggested we ask the ticketing desk manager for a voucher for car rental expenses, which we learned later that they couldn't provide. On top of that, Hawaiian Airlines announced that they scrambled a flight out at 1am the next day, well after we'd cancelled our travel package and while in the middle of the call with customer service.

About a day and a half later, a Thrifty rental car parked in our driveway, and out $500+, we're home safely, thank goodness. But there's still things that need to resolve, calls to be made, and receipts to submit; I just can't get over just how much hassle and frustration and uncertainty we had to go through.

Tldr: Flight from SAN-HNL was diverted and cancelled due to mechanical failure to a random airport, therefore Hawaii trip cancelled, but Hawaiian Airlines resisted refunding full costs and did not provide a way home.",empty83,9,0,HawaiianAirlines,HA,UNKNOWN

Flight is scheduled for 6:58pm take off

I’m through TSA @ 5:50pm and walking to the gate. 

As I get closer to my gate, I get a text from frontier stating my flight is delayed 30 minutes. I think damn! But still not the end of the world. 

I proceed to my gate which looks awfully like a United Airlines gate. Boarding should have started as I arrived. 

No one’s there. 

Suddenly a girl with a mobile laptop workstation comes running and is quickly trying to set it up to initiate boarding. 

The computer is having issues so she runs to get another station. 

*Our flight is still delayed*

She then makes an announcement 45 minutes later while sitting at the gate, that a flight departing to Denver Colorado will leave before Dallas’s flight. 

Okay np, what? A little more delay. That’s fine. 

The gate agents then explain that they just need a ramp crew to unload the plane on the Tarmac and that it will be fine once that happens. 

1 hour + of waiting. 

Suddenly, the gate agents move to the side in excitement and are shouting inaudible things. 

I go take a look, United has jumped in front of the Frontier plane to deboard. 

10 minutes later. United is unboarding, and I’m assuming that hey, Denver will be next, but where will this United Plane reload for it’s next flight?

40 minutes later. There is an announcement that Denver flight has been moved acrossed the airport to another gate. Folks exclaim with anger and immediately start heading back to the gate. 

30 mins later. As we continue to wait, there is still no update. I decided to go to the bathroom and asked a dude who I had been chatting with earlier to watch over my bag. As I’m using the bathroom, I hear over the loudspeaker

“Frontier Flight to DFW has been CANCELLED, please report to the desk for refunds”
I quickly run back to relieve the guy so we can both quickly run to get refunds. As we walk I check other Dallas flights. 

They gave me a refund for the flight and a shitty $100 voucher which I will never use. 

I was able to get a flight on another airline that night, however my return flight was still Frontier. I debated buying a SW flight as insurance just incase, however I didn’t. 

This flight was the LAST one back to my home state for the night. 

It was delayed due to “Maintenance being on board”

1 hour passed. Still no update - Gate agent is being extremely rude and acting as if I’m not allowed to ask questions. 

Suddenly 30 minutes later we begin to board. I feel like we’re in the safe. 

Suddenly I’m seated and as we are waiting for everyone to board, I get a text after everyone has boarded saying my flight departing at 9:05PM is now delayed until 10:59PM. 

Then, the captain goes on the overcom and tells us that his co-pilot evidently is NOT here and was told last second to fly another plane. 

So here we are, sitting in the plane. A few people trying to deboard. No idea if we have a co-pilot, when suddenly the pilot says he has to go to the gate to meet security and that a potential is on his way and will be here in hopefully 20-30 minutes. 

15 minutes pass. 

A gentleman that looks no older than 15 years old in a suit and tie boards the plane and fortunately we were then able to fly and make it around 1PM EST. What an absolute shit show.

Flight from Chicago Midway to Dallas Fort Worth on Friday, 10/11 could not have been better.  Seats have little or no padding but carry-on luggage, boarding, cabin service, equipment and flight times were great.  Pushed back early and arrived early.  In-Flight refreshment service was not offered so I cannot say if it was good or bad.

Return flight on Monday,10/14 was scheduled to depart at 1:41p.  At 7:30a I got a Flight Delay notice email  from Frontier with a new departure time of 3:23P.  An Hour and 40 minute delay due to a late arriving aircraft.  TF?  How do they know the aircraft will be delayed 5 1/2 hours from now?  Unless Frontier created the delay intentionally.   What puzzled me are 1)Departure times on the Frontier app and my TripIt app were not updated with the new departure time until almost 1:00p; 5 1/2 hours after Frontier knew there would be a delay.  2)My FlightAware app showed the inbound flight coming from Chicago O'Hare and ON-TIME.  Frontier switched the inbound flight to a later one coming in from Atlanta. Huh?  I'm no flight scheduler but it seems to me they're trying to support more flights than they have aircraft for.

I may fly Frontier again but knowing now that On-Time performance is a metric not used by Frontier; I will fully expect to be delayed.  I would not use Frontier when On-Time arrival is important to me.

I had a flight booked with Frontier from Las Vegas to Seattle through a third party, and I paid extra to bring my carry-on. I arrived on time for check-in at the gate, where the supervisor, Enela, who was extremely rude, checked my boarding pass and claimed I needed to pay for my carry-on again. I showed her the receipt proving I had already paid, but she insisted I hadn't and pushed me out of the line. Her behavior was shockingly unprofessional. She told me to stay close so I could pay and board the plane. I waited right in front of her, but when she finished with the other passenger, and I tried to pay again, she told me it was too late—the plane had already departed.

When I asked why she hadn’t said anything or asked a colleague to assist me, she responded dismissively, saying, 'It is what it is,' and offered to refund me. I didn’t want a refund; I needed to get to Seattle urgently due to an emergency. Instead of helping, she threatened to call security if I didn’t leave the gate. It was incredibly unfair and frustrating. I have traveled extensively with charters or companies, and have never witnessed such a negligent act.

An agent later told me, more politely, that this kind of situation happens often with Frontier and was sorry nothing could be done.

As a result, I had to pay significantly more and wait an additional 6 hours at the airport to catch a flight with Delta.

Although I was refunded immediately from Frontier, which to me confirms they knew they were at fault, it didn’t make up for the lost time and additional expenses.

Their complaint department is out of service. If anyone has experienced something similar or has advice on how I could pursue compensation for the time and money I lost, please share your thoughts. Thank you

My husband and I have flight this weekend for a wedding we are in. He had leave approved for a couple of months and his unit decided to tell him yesterday morning, 2 days beforehand that they do not care about his leave he is going to be in a class and miss the flight. Cool cool cool. 

I scour every flight option available and find one that will get him there Friday. I chat frontier and they have to split our booking to change his outbound flight. Okay great. 

I go to the app and change his flight, pay the $230 extra between the change fee and flight cost. Nope. I changed it for myself. Literally fml. We both immediately hop on the chat and no one is helpful. No one can reverse it back, I now have to spend $300 more for the same flight I already had and booked months ago. 

Can they just switch the names on the reservation? Also no. 

We finally agree to pay $200 for it to be fixed, they’ll waive the second change fee and made a huge deal about it. The chat disconnects. We’ve now spent 8 hours trying to talk to someone since then and no one will answer. We’ve tried calling and no one will answer. 

It’s literally been 12 hours of this now. At this point I’m wanting to cancel entirely and turn in the paperwork saying his leave was mandatorily altered for the class and can no longer travel on the dates we chose. 

Frontier has the military change/cancellation policy, but has anyone actually been successful with that?

I’d rather just drive the 23 hours with a toddler than ever step foot on their planes again.

440,1g4sbqg,2024-10-16 13:42:10,I’ve stopped rolling the dice,"I’ve only flown Frontier twice, and this past experience with a trip taken over the weekend is hands down the most insane flight experience I’ve had. Flew from SFO to OKC with a brief layover in Denver in between. The layover ended up being an hour longer, but I wasn’t too shocked about it. The entire trip took 6 hours. Getting back home from OKC to SFO (same layover in Denver) was the problem. It took 16 hours. My flight out of OKC was delayed 1 hour which meant I had 6 minutes to sprint to the connecting flight in Denver to SFO. The plane actually landed at a reasonable time window for me to make it to the connecting flight, but we ended up being stuck on the tarmac for half an hour. As soon as the door opened, I sprinted down 40 gates and missed the door by minutes. A few more people that came from my same flight trickled in after, and we were in absolute defeat. Apparently 15 people were missing in that flight. It was 10pm and the next flight to SFO was 11am the following day. 

I knew booking budget airlines meant managing your expectations to be very low, but I never would have imagined being in a situation where I had to stay in a nearby hotel due schedule changes that are completely out of control. Denver has a customer service desk, but there was only one person working. Getting my flight rescheduled and receiving accommodations took 1.5hours and I didn’t arrive to the hotel until 1:30am. 

If you’re traveling for an event/special occasion, I highly recommend avoiding budget airlines like Frontier because you could very likely miss it. I can’t imagine navigating this experience if you’re traveling with children/elders, have low stamina, health risks, or do not understand English to get help. 

As for me, I’m no longer rolling the dice. I’ll pay extra on an airline that has their standards straight. 

One last thing; Frontier doesn’t add up to be that much cheaper. My flight was $200 but they charge $140 if you need to bring a carry on. You could pay $400 for a reliable airline that doesn’t charge for every little thing. ",krackncheese,25,37,frontierairlines,F9,NEGATIVE

I begged her and explained the situation she didn't even offer to assist us or apologize for not being able to. I asked for her last name so I could report her for her rudeness and lack of empathy and poor customer service. When I told her why I wanted her last name she refused. I said if you think what you're doing is ethical, why won't you let me speak to a supervisor or give me your last name?

So my husband and I have had some bad experiences with frontier in the past. We’ve had flights canceled on layovers, no option for hotel - and then the refund was mailed to us three months later under my husbands name (even though I did all the booking). We’ve had whole days cut out of our vacations due to frontier just canceling our flights as we’ve shown up at the airport. 
This trip to Orlando has caused so many tears and I don’t know what to do anymore. 
Originally we were leaving the 11th- due to Milton our first round of flights got cancelled. That’s completely fine and made sense. We rescheduled for the next day. Then the next night we get the second alert that the lines were cancelled. We figured it was because the hurricane still, and felt frustrated but what can you do but work with the cards your given. Rebooked again. We get to the airport, and get on the plane and right as we are starting to leave… the plane never takes off. We sit, and are told that when they removed the loading dock somehow someone scraped the door, so they have to send maintenance down, but are assured from the pilot it’s an easy fix and just hang tight. An hour goes by, and everyone is just sitting on the plane waiting. The pilot again starts to say on the intercom they are just waiting for maintenance, but ASSURES us to not reschedule, because the “Have the staff and the man power” to make it to Orlando - and we will be leaving, so just hold tight. Next hour goes by, and the pilot says the plane was ready an hour and a half ago, but hasn’t been given the approval from HQ to leave. 
Another hour, the air got turned off, and the pilot offered everyone to get off the plane and walk around and he’d call us back when we’re leaving. That again there is no reason we wouldn’t leave tonight.
We get off the plane, and walk around a bit. 
Come back and another passenger told us while we were gone they made an announcement that the boarding would be soon. We hear nothing for another thirty minutes, and then everyone’s app all has changed the flight to the next morning at 10am. At this point we started to think we should just take the refund and book in full for another provider, but eventually don’t because of how much it was going to cost to buy another full round of tickets in 10 hours. 
The lady at the front said she had no clue why our apps say 10 am, because she was sure we would get on the plane that night. More time goes by, and the pilot lets us know that we won’t be leaving, and that we’ve all been rebooked for 10am. 
We leave the airport to get some sleep, and not only does the app not have any boarding time for our now 10 am flight… but even on the website it’s acting like we’ve already left (only
Showing our previous flight status). Since leaving we have had 3 additional delays - now pushing us to getting to Orlando at 2pm? Originally it was maintenance, which changed to inspection, which has now changed to “crew regulations”. 
A lot of tears tonight. I don’t think I would have been sooooo upset if the pilot hadn’t told everyone on the plane numerous times to not worry we would indefinitely be leaving. 
If anyone gets it this far, please can you give us any possible positive vibes or words of encouragement because holy shit I fucking hate this stupid airline. NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN I don’t care how cheap the rates are.

- Frontier has no live phone support, WHEN your flight is delayed/canceled, you will be left to deal with a robot loop. Your only option is to give your confirmation code which the system cannot recognize (T,D,E,G,B,C all sound similar) and will eventually hang up on you. 

- Their “chat” option is simply a bot that redirects you to their website to change your flight if needed.

-Service agents are nowhere to be found at the gate to help. When they do eventually show up, they are rude and useless. 

-It is Frontier’s policy that once a flight has been “closed” they will not book you on that flight EVEN if it isn’t leaving for another hour and they have plenty of seats available. 

Verdict- Pay a little more and fly a reputable airline that has their sh*t together. ",Old-Strain1503,59,47,frontierairlines,F9,NEGATIVE

463,1g0u6ji,2024-10-11 05:48:52,My First Frontier Experience!,"I had scheduled a last minute flight with Frontier for the first time to get to a funeral the next day. I expected a few things based on what I read online such as that there’s like a 10% chance things could go terribly wrong (best to have a Southwest just-in-case flight ready) and that if I missed the flight then I wouldn’t be able to get another one for like 3 days. Here was all the noteworthy things that actually happened during my experience:

- Carry on luggage costs about $50 twice (round trip) although your handheld bag is still free to take. Surprisingly even after that fee, my flight was $200 cheaper than if I had flown Delta
- The website is constantly bugging you to add extra stuff to your order, you just gotta keep scrolling and pressing X
- The flight location changed within like the last 30 mins from E to T on the whole other side of the airport. There was no delay and I would’ve missed my flight if I didn’t make a run for it the whole way. I feel sorry for the walking middle aged man that was told about the update at the same time as me
- The seats weren’t uncomfortable. There was no screens and you’d have to pay for snacks
- The flight attendants spent a good amount of time advertising to the whole plane to buy Frontier’s snacks and alcohol
- The people were respectful, no issues except a baby that screamed a few times
The plane was pretty small and it was half empty. I moved to a new spot after sitting between a couple
- No issues flying either. Getting off the ground and exiting the plane after the flight is much faster than Delta

Overall I give it a 6.5/10. They almost screwed me over but it went really well for the price

They ask for data again. I give them. Then, they tell me they cannot send me the check, because I'm in Europe, and that they'll do a wire transfer. I've been asking them for a wire transfer all along.

504,1fxc46m,2024-10-06 16:43:42,Frontier scammed me to pay $99 for my personal bag. What next?,"Hello all, I have been a frontier client for a long time, and today I had the worst experience in LGA airport. 

I have a personal laptop bag which is little bigger than most common bag but is with in the dimension of what frontier recommends, i.e., 14”x18”x8”. We were returning from New York (LGA) to Dallas (DFW) after a wonderful vacation with family (me, wife, daughters- 1.5yo, 4yo, 9yo, brother-in-law, his spouse, and in laws). We had a flight at 10:50pm, and definitely the gate agent noticed my bag; it’s not my first time. The agent asked me to check the size in the bin they had. I had travelled so many times in frontier and I was 100% sure it would fit. I tried and it didn’t fit just by even less than an half inch, it was a surprise to me; in my more than 100 flights and numerous bin check, I never had this issue. I have DEN deals and always fly via Frontier DFW-DEN (convenient and cheap) for my work. I was not sure what went wrong because I had less stuff than what I used to have.

The agent asked me to pay $99 for the bag since it no longer qualifies for personal bag. Then I noticed the bin they asked me to test was of Air Canada. I requested the agent that the bin is different that is why my bag didn’t go through. The agent was adamant and said there is nothing wrong with the bin (basically said the size is same) and asked me to pay $99. I was trying to defend my best but the agent didn’t budge. And there was another agent who played scare tactics and closed the door and went inside saying that we can no longer onboard. Now the panic started specially with my wife, she nearly broke down to tears and asked me to pay the money and leave the matter. I looked back and the panic was visible in all the family members. All the happy face turned pale. The agent gave me last chance to pay and board. Because the situation changed drastically I paid the $99 fee and we boarded the plane. I felt so bad and disappointed.

Now comes the interesting part. Because the bag did’t fit, it was a mystery to me and I need to figure out why. It’s 3:30 am and instead of sleeping I am posting this, it is the proof how bad it hit me, whole flight i was thinking what happened there with the bag. Now I come and check the details, the Air Canada personal bag size is: 13”x17”x6”. That was sufficient enough size difference for my bag.

Now I think there must be lots of victim of this scam Frontier is running. Fortunately my brother in law recorded enough proof of it in today’s event.

What shall I do? Can I sue them; there must be lots of victim. They made me feel embarrassed and my wife panicked and cried; I felt so bad. It left a bitter taste for all of us after such a wonderful vacation. What do you guys suggest?

Sorry for the long post and thank you for reading.

UPDATE (10/11/2024): After few multiple tries, they refunded $99. Phew!

Lesson learned: Please check the bin if it is has correct dimensions and get the proof if not.",062bel313,81,60,frontierairlines,F9,NEGATIVE

____________

Long time Delta loyalist here, with a smattering of Southwest flights over the years. We live outside of ATL, so the hub has always made sense. However, I’ve booked us on an upcoming flight into ORD as the departure times on Frontier were ideal. A few questions (yes I can google but I trust redditors opinions more):

We will only have a carry on and a personal bag. Do I need to pay for one?

I like the low price of upgraded seats. Is the pricing pretty straightforward or should I expect hidden fees?

Any other tips, tricks, or advice for a first timer? Thank you in advance!

So im trying to change the times that are more appropriate for my travel, but the app makes me pay for the change.

Looking to fly SFO-DCA and for some reason Frontier is like the only airline that will fly me back out of DCA. After stalking this sub, I get it: Don't book connecting flights with Frontier, but I fear I have no other choice. Attached screenshot is the flight I'm looking at. The other option is a 7-hour layover in Denver, but then I'd fly in at midnight which is too late for my liking. Both flights would be on 11/12, the Tuesday after Veteran's Day. Has anyone had experience with connecting flights through Denver? Is it worth going through with this ticket? Thanks
