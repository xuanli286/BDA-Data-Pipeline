199b5l4,2024-01-18 07:26:34,Using Membership Rewards for Air France with Delta Status ?,"Can I do this?

I am trying to take my Mom to Ireland for her birthday. I live in Denver, she lives in Mobile (Lower Alabama). Im also trying to do this fairly economically. I can get us out of Denver on Delta using Sky Miles or booking MR with my husband's AMEX account (would be less than 99k MR because Delta is tagged as his preferred airline), but it would be better to fly out of ATL because she has the less flexible schedule. However, ATL is almost double what DEN is on Delta, but about the same on Air France if I use points.

So I was thinking, could I transfer my husbands MR points to a Flying Blue account in his name, then use those points to book a flight for Mom and me, then link my SkyMiles account to be able to access my medallion benefits? Im a Gold medallion, so I know not much, but it is better than nothing?

I have a Delta Reserve and Im also an authorized user on his AMEX Platinum. So lounge access is less of an issue? I guess?

Anyway! If anyone knows the best way I can do this, I'd be very much appreciative.

1906st1,2024-01-07 02:42:38,Reclaim My Status has been updated,"The requirements for the Reclaim My Status program look to have been updated on the website.

It still has the notice about them looking forward to sharing updates with you soon, but the thresholds have changed over already.

Updated requirements are as follows, and all must occur within a three month window after getting approved. They‚Äôre pure MQD, which can be met with a combo of flight spend and card spend, just like the regular status qualification now. 

* Silver: $1250
* Gold: $2500
* Platinum: $3750
* Diamond: $7000

So as before, it‚Äôs one quarter of the annual requirement and grants status until February 2026.

Card spend only applies if within the challenge period. Signup bonuses do not apply. 

&gt; MQDs earned on travel during the Offer Period on Delta, Delta Connection, and SkyMiles Partner Airlines on qualifying flights will count towards Reclaim My Status. MQDs earned through other sources during Offer Period, including but not limited to Delta SkyMiles American Express Cards, will count towards Reclaim My Status. MQDs earned from MQD Headstart using an eligible Delta SkyMiles¬Æ American Express Card will not apply towards required MQDs for the Status Match offer, even if the eligible card is acquired during the Offer Period

As a reminder, MQD from cards earns 20:1 for the DL Platinum AMEX and 10:1 for the DL Reserve AMEX.

16k4c8e,2023-09-16 18:44:20,How do the target (big AMEX spend) customers react to the SkyMiles changes?,"I commiserate with those who earn status with miles/segments/ticket spend. I would feel abandoned losing DM status after years of Delta and AMEX loyalty.  These perks make frequent travel bearable.

I don't see much discussion from those who will retain status. My own scenario will net DM status in 2025, assuming I continue weekly travel and keep spending on my Reserve card. (Just a perk of procuring stuff for clients, not a flex on personal spending!) In theory I should feel some pending sense of exclusivity with less crowded lounges and more frequent FC upgrades.  That is Delta's stated goal. In reality, I feel just as devalued as a customer as those who will lose or downgrade in status.  The conversion ratios on MQM rollover and Reserve card spend are insulting.

There is a fundamental marketing mistake with this shift. A company cannot make its highest status customers feel more exclusive simply by taking away something from those with lower status. Are we supposed to feel *less* insulted, more enamored with our silly bag tags?  If this move is about returning to the days of exclusivity, then Delta needs to make simultaneous and tangible improvements for its supposed best customers, not just fiddle with the metrics. I understand there are impending changes to Choice Benefits, but I doubt they will make PM/DM customers feel valued or give those on the cusp aspirational motivation.

I flew SRQ-ATL-JFK-GVA and MXP-ATL-SRQ this month, partly D1 and partly C+. The level of service remains exemplary, but the actual planes are not good. Two segments were on old Lion Air 737s, two on 767-300s with the industry's oldest lie flat seats, and one on an old Latam A350 with broken plugs, no wifi, and no air vent adjustment (for a 10 hour flight). SkyClub crowding was not the main problem. In JFK we skipped the SC for Virgin's Clubhouse. There is a glimpse of the exclusive experience Delta needs.",Wild_Butterscotch482,19,20,DeltaAirlines

I called customer service. I waited on hold 3 minutes.  The extremely helpful representative was able to rebook leg 3, quickly resecure my upgrade on leg 2 and applied upgrades to Leg 3.  She managed to do it for less miles than I thought it would cost and now I get to be home 36 hours earlier.  

I was so grateful and told her how wonderful she was.  She thanked me for my kind words and I replied I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve had a tough few weeks. She just sighed heavily and said ‚Äúyeah‚Äù.  We didn‚Äôt discuss the changes other than that vague reference. 

30 minutes later I got an email that the last portion of Leg 3 had been cleared into FC.  It‚Äôs only an hour flight but it felt like good karma üòù",NoFilterNoLimits,2,16,DeltaAirlines

1addpty,2024-01-29 05:31:30,Delta changed itinerary mid-flight and won't reimburse,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping someone might have some advice or insight on how to deal with this situation. The title gives you my main point, but here's what happened:

My fiance was flying back to Los Angeles from the east coast last Tuesday (1/16). The flight was supposed to go from BDL --&gt; DTW --&gt; LAX. They got stuck on the tarmac for about an hour, leaving barely a 15-minute window for his layover. I noticed that on the website Delta had put him on an alternative flight, leaving at 9 pm from DTW (the original flight was supposed to leave at 3:50 from DTW). I called Delta to get some clarity, and the lady I spoke to explained that an alternative flight was ONLY if he didn't make the 3:50. Literally three times, she said, ""If he makes his flight, he's good to go."" The original flight was still showing on his itinerary, so it seemed fine. 

The BDL flight gets to DTW at 3:40 and somehow he (and a few other passengers from that flight) make it to the gate before boarding closed - but the gate agent told him that he wasn't allowed on because they already rebooked him and couldn't put him back on. The other passengers from the first leg were not rebooked.. only him. 

So he gets put on another flight going from DTW --&gt; MSP --&gt; LAX. Again, the flight is stuck on the tarmac for over an hour, and he and a couple of other passengers get to their gate at MSP too late - apparently just having missed the flight by a minute. That was the last flight of the night to LAX or anywhere near us, so he had to stay in Minneapolis and wait till early in the morning. 

Due to his health, just staying at the airport overnight after a long day of travel really wasn't an option. So he checked into the hotel right by the airport and made it home the next day but down the cost of a hotel stay and losing half a day of work. 

I called Delta when he got back to try to understand why he wasn't allowed onto his original flight and to submit a request for them to cover the cost of the hotel since they put us in this situation. I've been back and forth with them via phone calls and emails all week and I've gotten useless answers so far:

* ""We don't know why he wasn't let on.. the gate agents must have made a mistake""
* ""If he has health concerns he should have kept his belongings with him "" \[really hurt by this one, he was told he had to check in his carryon at BDL and a small backpack can only keep so much...\] 
* ""As a courtesy, we can offer some SkyMiles"" 
* The latest: ""Well, he really had to be at the airport 30 minutes before boarding, so that's probably why they rebooked him"" \[but the other passengers weren't rebooked...\] 

Obviously, the most important thing is that he got back home safe and sound. But the airline put us in a position where we had to take on another cost, and they keep using ""weather"" as an excuse not to make things right. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Have you had luck with Delta reimbursing costs due to their error? Any advice would be super appreciated.

When I have exclusive dinner parties with my poorer ultra wealthy friends who don't fly private, they all tell me that they only want to be surrounded by people who look like them when they fly. They don't even want to smell common frequent fliers who didn't inherit their wealth and pay for first class. They don't even want to smell them through that mesh curtain from Comfort+. They want the working class frequent fliers sitting all the way in the back. 
With this in mind, under extreme secrecy because of obvious impending outrage, I formulated this new program called SkyMONEY! 
No longer can you get upgrades or visit the skyMoney Clubs unless you make $500,000.00+ per year. And obviously already buy First Class every time. You can visit the improved skyMONEY club if you can afford to purchase a new Mercedes on your Amex every year, and book all your hotel, car rentals, and vacations through delta.com because you have total control of all your travel since you don't travel for work. Only for pleasure like the photos in our marketing campaigns.

The new skyMONEY program is much simpler for everyone. Now we don't have to bother with upgrades because the only people eligible have already purchased First Class. 
Now you don't have to bother with tracking anything like miles or segments. We don't care how often you fly with us anymore. And why track it because you won't qualify anyway. If you do qualify, someone from your staff probably manages those menial tasks for you.

It gets even better. You now don't have to look for, or wait in line for our new skyMONEY clubs because you aren't invited! 
It doesn't matter if you have been Diamond Medallion for decades. You can now sit right there at the gate because there is no affordable path to entry into our new skyMONEY club. It's now reserved for C-Suite executives like all my friends who don't need them because we simply drive them in Porche SUVs from gate to gate already! 
As you see, we really care about all of our Medallion members. After these changes, we will care about you so much more because there will only be a couple dozen of you. And you are all my friends and neighbors from the country club already.

To assist you, we have even added to your wait on the phone lines in order to tell you to visit our website for more information because we want you get used to waiting longer for phone support again.

Don't forget to rate this communication on clarity. Make sure you don't rate it on your opinion on this change. And please don't  talk about these changes because that wouldn't be fair to our hard working front line employees. They are the best because we negotiated less pay for them all this year so the top execs and I could pay Tom Brady to hang out with us at our corporate retreats in Maui.

Isn't being the CEO awesome!

Ticketed on Delta One from CMH-BOS-DUB. The ticket was fully refundable and purchased last fall at a very good fare.  
Flying out of CMH isn't as convenient for me as flying out of DAY but the DAY flights were going to be to ATL-DUB and the cost was roughly $1500 more.

Out of curiosity I looked to see how much the change fee would be to change to DAY-ATL-DUB on the exact original dates. It came up with no additional cost to change to those flights. I did it before they could change their mind. Could it have been because there were some schedule changes on my original flights? ",ryboltcox,10,5,DeltaAirlines

2. Is it possible to apply a companion certificate after booking.  We're looking to fly later in the summer but would always like to book ahead of time, so just having it applied to a ticket would be better for us.

1fskdft,2024-09-30 09:41:56,Amex has not issued companion certificates since June. ,"My Amex Delta Reserve card and the additional paid card for my wife renewed on September 2, 2024. I‚Äôve been checking my Delta profile certificates section daily since then to ensure that the companion certificate has been issued, which has not been issued. I reached out to Delta about two weeks ago and they told me that August and September 2024 companion certificates have not been issued due to a technical issue with Amex. 

Still without a companion certificate nearly a month after the renewal,  I reached out to Amex this evening. They finally confirmed, after going back and forth with a frontline CS agent and a supervisor‚Äîwhen I asked if they have not issued certificates for August and September renewals, the supervisor confirmed that they have not issued July, August, or September certificates. 

I asked why there has not been a communication to customers about the issue and shouldn‚Äôt there be compensation in the form of renewal extensions due to the inability to use the greatest value benefit, in my opinion, of the Delta Reserve card. He said those were valid points and would elevate them and to check back in a week.

A bit somber in that they loaded a fallen soldier into the cargo hold for his final trip back home. Had a ceremony on the tarmac with color guard. Very nice gesture. Apparently a uniformed soldier was also onboard to accompany the coffin and ensure proper unloading upon landing. Uneventful flight and I basically fell asleep listening to iTunes. We land, taxi to the gate, I hear the Ding, Ding and stand up to start gathering my stuff. I rather quickly notice that no one else is standing and I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs weird. The FA then makes an announcement to please remain seated until the soldier deplanes. Yikes, I guess they announced that upon descending but I never heard the announcement!  Talk about being embarrassed. So I quickly sat down, the soldier stood up, everyone clapped, he got off the plane and then the FA waved her arms and the usual deplaning commotion ensued.

17ikgpc,2023-10-29 02:57:35,TIFU by requesting original routing credit (ORC),"Today I f***ed up because I requested original routing credit.

I was flying back to the US on a Delta-ticketed flight with segments operated by KLM and Delta. Because a weather delay in Amsterdam would have caused me to miss a connection, Delta offered to change tickets. I changed flights through Delta text support to a KLM-operated flight, that saved me a connection in the US.

When I got to Amsterdam, KLM couldn't find my ticket, and a help desk agent had to issue me a new ticket. 

In the Delta app my new segment hadn't showed for a couple of days so I made a note to call back for original routing credit ORC so I could get 1000 MQMs more.

While I was on hold on the phone and they were filing the ORC, I realized that KLM had issued me a ticket in fare class D which had a 150% MQM bonus and it was much more MQD than my original ticket. But once the ORC was filed, there was no way back. If I had done nothing, I would be 1600 MQM, 800 MQD, 7000 RM richer.

It doesn't affect my status for next year, but I'm kicking myself for not looking before I called. Moral of the story is to wait a couple of days after flying to make sure everything processes, and sometimes re-ticketing could be in your favor.",MonitorGeneral,10,11,DeltaAirlines

Would it be better to downgrade the card to gold, or cancel it and apply for a new gold? 

Main concerns. 
1- hit to credit score by canceling. Have a 15k limit which helps debt/income ratio. I'm sure a new card could get the same, but still a hit. Have a 800+ score currently. 

2- if I downgrade instead of applying for a new card, I would forgo a good potential sign on offer (currently only 40k miles I see). I don't think they would do a downgrade offer, and I would lose future chances since it's once in a lifetime per card I think.

Currently I have enough SkyMiles to cover Platinum for 24 and 25.

I currently have the Delta AMEX Reserve card as well as a Delta Platinum Card.

I plan to keep Reserve and drop the Delta Platinum. I'll only use the reserve card to rack up enough dollars to keep my Platinum Status. And with rollover miles over 2 years I can probably get platinum in 26 as well.

Over the next two years I plan 4 to 6 trips per year with two of those International. The international ones may or may not be on Delta depending on the best deal I can get.

So my question is, should I consider another travel card like Capital One x venture or the AmEx Platinum. Or, just rack up points on a lower tier card like Chase Sapphire Preferred and transfer miles to their travel partners. Already have about a 170,000 points on that card.

Thanks in advance.

Much to our surprise, as we were sitting in the T SkyClub, we got notification our bags had been loaded. Hmm, that‚Äôs weird, as our inbound aircraft hadn‚Äôt yet arrived. Look in the app and our bags were ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù to the 16:00 flight. 

I keep putting optimized in quotations because, ironically, the 16:00 flight was delayed until after our flight arrived into DCA; we got in around 19:30, and our bags got in around 21:15. 

Delta was great about the entire ordeal. We got an email in flight stating our bags would be delayed and that we should proceed to the baggage help desk at DCA. The help desk was quick and efficient. Since we live locally, I was worried she was going to tell us to wait an hour - nope! We will get your bags delivered to you tonight or first thing tomorrow if we can‚Äôt find a driver tonight. 

Delta uses Roadie to deliver luggage. The whole trip is well documented via email and text message.

But the app never updated my boarding pass. Still showed the original flight. Went to see a gate agent who rebooked me on the original flight, and a slightly later connecting flight, now arriving at final destination at 18:30.

15mjwyf,2023-08-10 00:21:35,Thoughts on rumored SkyClub Access changes,"I know many aren't active here, but since the other sub is filled with people learning about thunderstorm summer shitshows for the first time, I figured I would try out this sub.

## Background

A reddit user [posted about changes coming to SkyClub access here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/15j7fy0/any_upcoming_new_cards_or_exciting_news/juybnpe/). According to this user:

* Delta Platinum cards will no longer have the ability to purchase daily access (previously was $50/airport/day)
* Amex Platinum cards will be limited to 6 SkyClub visits per year (previously unlimited)
* Delta Reserve cards will be limited to 10 SkyClub visits per year (previously unlimited)
* If you spend $75k/year on Delta Reserve card, the access limit goes away

The user provided a [non-update update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/15lp7sq/delta_qa_in_regards_to_benefits_and_updates/) with promises to fill in more information. This user honestly isn't super credible, with some questions around previous comments and incorrect advice/info. BUT, it would not surprise me if various access limits and controls get put in place in the next year.

The crux of the problem is that Delta lounges are, on average, a bit nicer than the American and United equivalents. Further, you can access a Delta lounge on the proprietary Amex Platinum, whereas other airlines require you to have the most premium cobrand card (equivalents to Delta Reserve) for access. During COVID, Amex handed out large sign-up bonuses for the Amex Platinum, and it pivoted the Platinum to more of a ""Lifestyle"" card with various credits from the traditional ""travel"" card that it used to be. This exploded cardholder numbers, which in turn have overwhelmed SkyClubs.

Things Delta did to limit access during or post-COVID:

* Removed access for Delta SkyTeam ElitePlus on international itineraries
* Implemented 3 hour rule (can not access club more than 3 hours before departure)
* Implemented no access on arrival rule that was quickly walked back
* Removed employee travel access
* Removed access for SkyClub Members if traveling Basic Economy

It would not surprise me to see Amex Platinum access curtailed, pushing people to get the Delta Reserve. If Delta is the only airline that can have a non-cobrand access the lounge, it seems likely that that card will have the benefit nerfed or cut. It also would not surprise me to see different layers of ""unlocking benefits"" by spending on the Delta cards, similar to what Amex did on the Centurion lounge access.

I'm not sure of the specifics, but I believe there needs to be a notice period before making changes to card benefits. A few govt sites [Help with my bank](https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/help-topics/credit-cards/fees-terms/terms/terms-notify.html), [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/can-my-credit-card-company-change-the-terms-of-my-account-en-70/) state it as 45 days. If Delta is trying to make some changes for the start of 2024, it seems like we will get an announcement in September or October.",URtheoneforme,19,9,DeltaAirlines

1eb1wsp,2024-07-24 21:47:21,A Heartwarming Moment at 5 AM: A Pilot‚Äôs Kindness and a Young Boy‚Äôs Bravery,"
This morning, I witnessed something truly special that I wanted to share. Amidst what has been probably one of the most stressful weeks for airlines since 2001, our flight DL2571 was fully booked and 80% boarded. Just ten minutes before departure, our pilot stepped off the plane and walked through a full jetway of 40 people, down the jetway zig-zagging down the ramp. He approached a mother and her probably three-year-old son, who was visibly overwhelmed by the whole boarding process.

In a gesture that went above and beyond, the pilot reached into his pocket and handed the young boy a pair of wings and a playing card sitting with him at his level talking about the flight. This small act of kindness captured the boy‚Äôs attention and helped alleviate his fear long enough for the pilot and  his mom to get him settled on the plane which she has done flawlessly. Thanks to the pilot‚Äôs thoughtful actions, we had an on-time departure and the flight is going great.

It was a touching moment to witness at 5 in the morning. Seeing the pilot go out of his way to help, and the young boy bravely overcoming his fear, was a beautiful reminder that moments of kindness and unity can still happen in the divisive, negative world we live in.

Kudos to the mom for her efforts, and a big thank you to the pilot for making such a difference. The young boy can now proudly say he has flown as a co-pilot!",Due-Principle9044,21,77,DeltaAirlines

In ancient times I had bought a PanAm Clipper Club lifetime membership which, of course, became useless when PanAm disappeared (how sad).  A few years later, surprise, Delta took over the Clipper Club membership and I became a lifetime Sky Club member.  This turned out to be a good move because, even though United took over the PanAm pacific routes I fly, Delta sucked me in to becoming a Delta addict.

This brings me to the question since I am in the process of being demoted from Platinum soon to possibly nothing.  I don't have a physical Sky Club membership card but have never been denied Sky Club entry, usually on a D1 boarding pass but sometimes on C+.  

The question is whether my Sky Club membership is embedded in the QR code of the boarding pass?  Or am I going to have to go thru the hassle of somehow getting a physical membership card?  Further, will I even be permitted entry if on C+?

1909bhr,2024-01-07 04:29:50,Advice: JAL economy vs Delta Comfort Plus?,"My husband and I will be traveling to Japan this Fall (October) for our honeymoon.  LAX to Tokyo, likely Haneda.

I‚Äôve heard that JAL (Japan Airlines) has some of the best economy seats around, but I‚Äôve also heard good things about other airline‚Äôs premium economy option like Delta‚Äôs Comfort Plus. 

JAL economy vs Delta Comfort Plus round trip tickets are comparable in terms of price so I‚Äôm having a hard time deciding which would be the better choice for the 12 hour flight. 

Side note- I am a very anxious flyer so I‚Äôm hoping for the most comfortable option (still affordable of course lol).

16io999,2023-09-15 01:21:28,I don‚Äôt care about this change and I‚Äôm curious why you do?,"Here‚Äôs my situation: I am platinum this year and I‚Äôm not sure why because I don‚Äôt understand the entire methodology Delta uses for status. But I fly Delta about 10-12 times a year included an international flight. I also have the Delta Amex platinum card. 

With the exception of Sky Priority, which I love for a short line for checking bags, I don‚Äôt know what great benefit status gets you. I have been upgraded to first a few times but those are on crappy regional jets for 30 minute flights, so yay, that‚Äôs neat. Once I got a note saying ‚Äúthanks‚Äù from a flight attendant, which was nice and a little odd. But otherwise nothing.  I got an email when I hit platinum saying there were other benefits, but the way it was explained would make an IRS employee say ‚Äúdamn, this is convoluted.‚Äù

Same with Sky Club. I‚Äôve been a few times and I always left thinking I spend $50 for $20 of food, sat in aesthetically pleasing but uncomfortable chairs while drunk people yelled into a speakerphone three tables away.  It‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not as good as the kimchi grilled cheese at Beetcher in SeaTac. 

I‚Äôll keep flying delta because right now it has the best timetable for me at my little regional airport, I‚Äôll keep my Amex because I like free bag checks and, well, I‚Äôm lazy.

&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve received a lot of feedback,‚Äù Bastian said during remarks at an Atlanta Rotary Club luncheon this week.

&gt; ‚ÄúI will tell you that we‚Äôre listening to the feedback. We are reading the feedback. Our reservation agents are talking to customers that call in, and and the feedback matters,‚Äù he said.

&gt; Bastian defended why Delta made the changes.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotten to the point honestly, where we have so much demand for our premium products and services, far in excess of our ability to serve effectively,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs Delta One (business class), whether it‚Äôs the Sky Clubs, whether it‚Äôs the upgrade certificate, whatever it is ‚Äî the special lines of agents that you know, pick up the phone immediately when you call.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúWe need to make certain that we can serve our higher tiers,‚Äù he said. But Bastian also indicated there will be some adjustments.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still assessing what we do, but there will be modifications we will make,‚Äù Bastian said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear about it sometime over the next few weeks.‚Äù

&gt; He acknowledged the changes may have been too draconian.‚ÄúNo question, we probably went too far,‚Äù Bastian said. ‚ÄúOur team wanted to kind of rip the Band-Aid off and didn‚Äôt want to have to keep going through this every year, with changes in nickel and diming and whatnot.‚Äù

&gt; But, he added: ‚ÄúI think we moved too fast. And so we‚Äôre looking at it now. ... We will be making modifications and changes. Because it really matters to us. We care about the feedback.‚Äù

I called that number and got a recording that they aren't actually taking calls at that number. I called Delta's main number and talked to a very pleasant CSR who said I had to talk to Customer Care but they only communicate via chat.

That was three hours ago. I haven't heard from anyone in the chat since then.

16ij4ul,2023-09-14 21:54:41,My personal plan of attack for 2024,"The news last night sucked. No other way to put it. But we have until the end of 2024 to make Delta and Amex regret this. So, this is my personal plan of attack, and perhaps you all can join too:

1. **No spend on Amex Cards, especially the co-branded Delta cards and the Amex Platinum.** Delta wants us to put all our spend on our Amex cards, so the best way to fight back is to just not use them. Milk the remaining benefits and SkyClub access for the rest of 2024, but only put the minimal spend on there. Use Chase, Citi, Discover, cash, check, or even Credit One for all I care. Don't give Amex and Delta your swipe fees. At the end of 2024/into 2025, cancel the Amex charge cards and downgrade the Delta cards to Gold or even Blue.

2. **Abuse the SkyClub access.** Going to also say don't be assholes to the SkyClub staff. They are not at fault for executives at Delta and Amex wanting higher bonuses for Christmas. But think to yourself: ""Will this cost Delta money?"" And if the answer is yes, then go for it. **Don't bring in guests**, but grab all the extra food you can and bring it to them. Go on, bring in that Tupperware or cleaned-out Country Crop/Cool Whip containers and fill them up. Order all the complimentary drinks with no intention of drinking them (obviously put them on the collection trays so the innocent staff doesn't have to clean up our mess). Dump all the candy and chips into your bag and walk out. Make Delta pay (literally) until they kick us out in 2025.

3. **Be airline agnostic.** This is kind of obvious, but shift your flights away from Delta now. Some of us (including myself) are stuck with DL if our home airport is ATL, DTW, MSP, and SLC. But there are still plenty of routes served by other airlines, so fly them. Hell, I got a Spirit flight next week and I'm glad I didn't book it on Delta (and Delta managed to make their loyalty program worse than Spirit's, so good job there, Ed).

4. **Medium-term: Get Congress to pass legislation to reduce credit card swipe fees.** There is currently the bi-partisan bill that Senator Dick Durbin has proposed again this year (Credit Card Competition Act of 2023), [but looking at the one-page summary](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/download/the-credit-card-competition-act-of-2023_-one-pager) it just says that it would require the ""largest credit-card issuing financial institutions in the country‚Äîthose with assets over $100 billion‚Äìto enable at least two credit card networks to be used on their credit cards instead of just one"" outside of Visa and Mastercard. While that will certainly help and it's a start, it looks like Amex and Discover are exempt. Maybe it's further in it, but what this bill needs is to cap credit card swipe fees at just 1%, or allow merchants to reject cards with higher swipe fees. That's where it would finally hurt Amex, Chase, Delta, American, etc. These airlines have basically turned into credit card companies that run airlines on the side, and they are banking on those swipe fees. It's time we close that source of revenue for them so that merchants don't need to increase their costs to cover the fees. We're not getting benefits from these cards anymore, so why should we keep paying more to use them?

5. **Long-term: Support better intercity transit that's not dependent on airlines.** Look, we are not going to get high-speed rail to replace transcontinental plane trips. However, many of Delta's flights out of their core hubs (ATL, MSP, DTW, maybe SLC) and some of their coastal hubs (SEA, LAX, BOS, JFK/LGA) are less than 500 miles that could be replaced with a robust inter-city train network of high and higher speed trains. But as it stands, most people's only options are a short flight or a long drive, and people should have an alternative to pick that isn't the current Amtrak setup. While the airline was mismanaged for years, what ultimately led to Alitalia's demise was Italy building up and opening up its rail network. Air France and KLM were already reducing their intra-France/Dutch/EU flights before laws were passed as people were picking the trains over the air (or even taking the train directly to the airport and then hopping on a longer flight from there). Even here in the US, Southwest Airlines has sued to stop high-speed trains in Texas because they know their customers would shift away from flying. US airlines have been dependent on a captive market (more so out of their fortress hubs), and it's time we start fighting for alternatives. Even if you know you will never take the train, people should have more choices when it comes to forms of transportation. Obviously, this won't happen even in the next 2 decades (just look at California), but the foundations can be built today.",jcrespo21,6,16,DeltaAirlines

18etaxl,2023-12-10 10:20:53,"If you leave a trackable iPad on a plane, will Delta ever give it back?","SPOILER: Yes, they do return located items. Mine is being shipped back today!

I accidentally left my iPad on a plane at MCO. Since iPads are trackable and I could see that they moved if off the plane right after I left the airport, I thought I could get it back. I called Delta and they said I had to file an online lost and found report, which I did. No response from Delta's lost and found yet, other than canned responses to say the item has not been located. After a few days, I saw it moving to four different locations. The last location is near this address:

3509 S Broad St., Scottsboro, AL 35769

Google associates this address with a lot of different things and the street view shows a strip mall. One hit in Google associates this address with ""Lost &amp; Found Central"" (on Manta), which makes me wonder if they've outsourced their lost and found, and makes me wonder if there's a chance I'll get it back.

I remotely sent a request to the iPad to go into ""lost"" mode (which would display my phone number on the screen), but that's still pending. Weird that I can get updates on the location of the iPad, but it can't go into ""lost"" mode.

I've been updating the location of the iPad on the online lost and found report, but I'm not sure if anyone at Delta is actually reading my updates. It feels like Delta does not try very hard to return even trackable items that should be very easy to get back to the correct person.

Anyhow, I would be curious to hear from anyone else's experience of whether Delta ever returns items left on planes or not.

UPDATE: I was contacted by Delta and they confirmed that the above location is their lost and found center. It is \*not\* the Unclaimed Baggage store that many here claimed it is (which is located 7 minutes away).  I was charged a very reasonable shipping fee and I should receive my iPad by the 14th (today is the 11th). I hope this helps others.  While I understand the frustration that many have had who have not been able to get their items back, it does seem that Delta does do a pretty good job trying to get people their stuff back. It makes sense that they have a centralized location to make returning items as efficient for them as possible. Way to go Delta!",spockdude,153,491,DeltaAirlines

I am PM until 2026, according to Delta.  Even if is a technical error, I am PM until 2025.  And this may not include my MQM conversation (200k+)

I am not taking under consideration my HUB/Airport (EWR) and I don‚Äôt mind traveling to LGA or JFK (for the most part) but considering the new changes with Delta I am taking a second hard look to  switching to United.  The year just began and I am starting to travel.  

There is no difference in gaining status for the first 3 tiers btw both carriers.  If I am considering $$ but the last tier, United is 4k less.  

Although I can take a year off from delta and regain it back in 2025, I am having a hard time wondering what I will really lose.

I'm left to figure this out on my own.  Unless I've printed the original data, a call to Delta is sometimes necessary.

Further, the change notice does not go away.  Therefore, I cannot tell if subsequent changes have been made.

Fare class has been eliminated (changed to purchased cabin), Million Miler is a lot more important, and MQDs earned in the current year replaces MQD waiver.


Effective January 1, 2024, upgrades clear at the following ranking:

1. Status (Diamond then Platinum then Gold then Silver then only Delta Reserve cardholder)
2. Cabin Purchased (Original + Paid Upgrades)
3. Million Miler status (Type of Million Miler [e.g. 3 MM &gt; 2 MM &gt; 1 MM] then non-Million Miler)
4. Delta Reserve cardholder (Cardholder then non-cardholder)
5. Delta Corporate Traveler (if you are traveling on a corporate ticket purchased through your company's travel portal or with a SkyBonus/SkyMiles for Business designator; corporate travelers then non-corporate travelers)
6. MQDs earned in the current calendar year, rounded to 100
7. Date/time of request (typically when you booked the ticket, or when you earned status or selected the ""make me eligible for complimentary upgrades). Note that check in time does not factor into upgrade priority at all

Example 1: Diamond who purchased Comfort+ will clear into First Class before a Diamond who purchased Main Cabin (and received a complimentary upgrade to Comfort+).

Example 2: Platinum who purchased Main Cabin, is a Million Miler, has the Reserve card, is flying on a corporate ticket, and earned $15,000 MQDs this year will be ahead of a Platinum who purchased Main Cabin, is a Million Miler, has the Reserve card, is flying on a corporate ticket, and earned $10,000 MQDs this year",URtheoneforme,8,43,DeltaAirlines

They were able to shut it after a few attempts, but a partial piece of the cabin door at the top was unable to latch/shut.

The pilot then went back to the cockpit and the flight attendant kept looking through the window to someone on the jetbridge as if they were going to try and close it again but to no avail.

Has anyone seen something like this before? I‚Äôd assume that part of the door being closed is somewhat important. Otherwise why would Airbus design the door to open/close like that?

1g4mqd0,2024-10-16 08:26:34,Advice on my next move ,"I was in Europe, had a family emergency come up, and I had to fly back to the US with 1 day notice. Flight cost me ALL of my delta sky miles  (72,000) plus ‚Ç¨200.

When I spoke to the FA about the broken seat she said they would document it on their end and to submit the complaint to delta. 

I wrote a letter to delta about this experience and submitted it through the complaint/feedback section. After ignoring me for a month, I called to see what was up. They said there was an error on their end which prevented the case from being looked at - they told me to submit ANOTHER complaint complaining that my original complaint wasn‚Äôt addressed.. 

Finally get a response and they offer me 10,000 sky miles - I tried to reason with them and re explain how that is not a fair compensation but they replied with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all we can do‚Äù 

I‚Äôm not asking for a full refund but I do think I should be getting more than 10,000 miles after spending 72k for a broken seat and broken WiFi - I would even take a future travel credit.

It's a 4 hour flight.  I booked main cabin - exit row - aisle seat.

For the record, I'm a diamond medallion.  I was offered an upgrade to comfort (middle seat), but I declined as I prefer the aisle.

Zone 2 boarding happens and my boarding pass doesn't scan.  They ask me to step aside.

Upon checking, the attendant says oh.  I gave away your seat a few minutes ago.  me: Huh?

She said someone came up and asked if they could switch to the exit row aisle and they gave them my seat.

I asked if they could switch them back, and she said no because he was already on the plane.  If he wasn't already on the plane, then she could've switched it back.

I asked if they put me in comfort then because it was offered to me, and she said no, that's gone too.

I said, please tell me I'm still on this plane.  She said I think so, let me check.

She moved me over 1 seat to the middle (thanks).  So I get on the plane, and there's no one in my original seat.  I sit down.

A few min later, the guy who took my seat comes up (he was in the wrong row) and says, I think your in my seat.  I show him my boarding pass on my phone which never changed to show that the aisle was my seat.

FA comes over and checks the actual manifest which shows I'm now middle... I accept fate and slide over 1 seat.

He says, so this was the seat you book, I say yeah.  He looks at me and says, funny... that (indicating where I'm now sitting) was my original seat.  You prefer aisle seats?  Me: yeah, that's why I booked it. Him: oh (pops on headphones, end of convo)

I don't know what happened at the gate and why he was switched, but that's some BS.  It could be an honest mistake where he just went up and asked if an aisle was available and it's not his fault at all.  If I were in his shoes, I would've offered to swap back as I wouldn't want to swap someone out of the seat they requested.

1g4n7v2,2024-10-16 08:51:05,Update on the WTF prices to SLC. I don't think I'm ever flying delta again,"So my post this morning showed that me booking a flight a week out from atl to SLC was over $1100, up to $1500 for a main cabin seat. 

The delta testicle garglers came out in droves telling me that's what happens when you book late, and that that's just the price you pay for delta, etc. I've flown this route almost 100 times at this point. I know when there's fuckery about. 

So I got curious and looked up a flight from my little municipal airport to Baltimore and from Baltimore to SLC. found a few options, but got curious. Delta from BWI to SLC on the same day, sitting my fat ass in the same seat was $700. Combined with the ticket from my hometown airport that would be knocking on $900 so I looked some more. Flying from Columbus georgia (about and hour from atl) and laying over in Atlanta was about the same as the original flight, but flying out of savannah (a little too far for your average atlantian to drive to) was only $700. 

Delta is literally price gouging it's hometown residents, systemically, and purposefully. 

This is straight up anti-trust fodder. They monopolized a route, and are bending over thier customer base, ramming it in dry, and having the audacity to thank us for flying the friendly skies. 

Fuck delta. Seriously. I was a huge fan boy, 5 years straight diamond, probably over $150k spent. 

I'm gonna start flying whoever is cheapest, period. Spirit, frontier, Jim bobs airplane and carburetor repair, I don't give a shit anymore. It's just a fucking plane ride. No amount of sunchip 5 packs and half a can of coke is worth this. 

What sucks is that Atlanta is by far the closest airport to me, and the ones that are close enough to drive to are all kinda delta owned too. 

It be your own people, I swear. The state of Georgia has dished out so much pride for delta, and put so much trust in the company, just for them to literally bend us over when they are almost the only option. ",Superslinky1226,28,0,delta

This is where it gets creative. After he clears all his stuff he ever so intentionally knocks his drink all over the seat and goes, ""Oh dang. It looks like the seat is all wet. No way you're going to want to sit there now. I'll go ahead and just sit in the wet seat.""

Flight attendant comes over with some super vacuum and starts drying the seat. At this point, several people in the other rows start yelling at the guy that they ""know he did that on purpose"" among some other colorful commentary. Flight attendants are not happy with the guy.

Once the seat is dried, he repeats ""I wouldn't want you to have to sit in the wet seat. I'll take it.""

From December through February, Delta Air Lines is set to introduce daily nonstop flights on its New York JFK to Lagos route, enhancing its connectivity between the two destinations. This seasonal adjustment aligns with the airline‚Äôs goal of providing greater accessibility for travelers during this busy period.

During this time, Delta will upgrade its aircraft on the route from the Airbus A330-200, which accommodates 223 passengers, to the more advanced and spacious Airbus A330-900neo, offering seats for up to 281 passengers. This change not only boosts capacity but also enhances the overall comfort and travel experience for customers flying this route.

The introduction of the Airbus A330-900neo reflects Delta‚Äôs commitment to offering state-of-the-art aircraft equipped with improved features, allowing passengers to enjoy a more modern and seamless journey. By upgrading to this newer model, Delta aims to cater to the evolving expectations of international travelers.

Delta views this expansion as more than just an increase in seat availability; it is part of the airline‚Äôs broader strategy to meet growing customer demand while ensuring that passengers experience a higher standard of service. The change is also aimed at supporting the rising popularity of the New York to Lagos route.

The airline emphasizes that this transition is in direct response to customer feedback, showcasing Delta‚Äôs proactive approach in adjusting its operations based on passenger preferences and travel patterns. By listening to its customers, Delta is better positioned to make informed decisions about which routes and services to enhance.

Delta further noted that understanding customer preferences is central to its operational philosophy. This continuous monitoring allows the airline to strategically adjust its offerings in response to emerging trends and market demands, ensuring its services remain relevant and appealing.

The increased frequency and capacity on this route come at a time when air travel between the United States and Nigeria continues to see steady growth. Delta‚Äôs decision to upgrade this service highlights the importance of Lagos as a key destination in its international network.

In a statement, Delta confirmed that expanding services to Lagos is a direct response to the strong demand they have observed in the market. The airline has received positive feedback from customers, signaling satisfaction with their current services and encouraging further growth.

Overall, this enhancement in Delta‚Äôs offerings showcases the airline‚Äôs commitment to delivering a superior travel experience while maintaining a customer-centric approach, which has been a cornerstone of its success in the competitive aviation industry.",radar1989,0,4,delta
1c4vow1,2024-04-16 03:52:08,Passenger in front of me got yelled at for activating Oxygen mask system,"Flight from LAX to OGG. During the initial pilot message, he said it should be a smooth ride for most of the flight; however, there would be unavoidable turbulence during the descent and approach to OGG. During the descent the seatbelt sign went on earlier than I would expect, and in fact the head flight attendant announced during the period in which the flight attendants make their final pass to collect any trash, to please just put your trash in the seat pocket and it would be collected by the ground crew. The FA's immediately went to their jump seats.  


The final approach was very bumpy and one set of oxygen masks dropped down in the row ahead of me. It was only those four masks, no others. The one passenger in that row grabbed the mask and put it on. A few seconds later the plane landed. I heard the flight attendant say something to the effect that he did not need to put the mask on. I am not sure whether this was before or after the passenger grabbed the mask.   


While disembarking other flight attendants criticized him for putting on the mask while the planes was landing, one saying that there was no loss of pressure.   


I don't think it was right for him to be chastised. If there was a depressurization and the masks dropped I believe that you are not suppose to wait for an FA to say put the mask on, or check to see if the masks were down in other rows. Besides the FA probably could not make such an announcement as the FA is probably putting his own mask on.",jurassickayak,309,2512,delta

167f85d,2023-09-02 02:38:49,Stop asking people to switch seats,"I booked my window seat months back at the very front of the plane (1st premium economy seat). The reason I did this was because it was an international flight to a different country where I would have to go through immigration (it is visa on arrival and hence the lines are pretty wrong). No sooner had I settled in than this family arrived to my row (father, mother, 16-18 year old). I had my headphones in, had already cleaned my seat, wiped it down and had all my stuff stored. 

The mother proceeds to ask me to switch seats so that they would all sit together. The funniest part was that these people had booked the middle and aisle seat for the parents and then put their child in a middle seat in economy. So they expected me to downgrade both cabin and seat.

I generally do not entertain any request for a seat change regardless of the circumstances. So I found their request hilarious to say the least. I just responded ""No, thank you"" and proceeded to put my headphones back on and ignore them. The lady continued to ask or whatever she was saying since I had my headphones on and couldn't hear her. I refused to acknowledge or even engage her. She called the FA over and I kept my headphones on, with no intention of engaging or giving anyone any audience on anything concerning a seat I booked and paid for.

After about 5 minutes, I saw them move to the other cabin. It seems they ended up downgrading to sit with their child and I got two new neighbors!

1g93ro1,2024-10-22 07:15:30,First time making Diamond. Advice on Choice Benefits,"I think for my situation it's fairly simple but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Plan is to take the 4 GUC's and use that for the wife and I in D1 LAX to SYD or HND in the 2nd half of 2025. Looking now it seems like there is solid immediate availability if booked far enough in advance and buying PS.

Then thinking to use the other two on the MQD accelerator for $4k total. As evident by this being my first time making DM, I typically hit PM too late in the year to realistically push for DM. The main difference this year was a large one time expense of around $50k that I was able to put on my Reserve which got me to DM by mid-Oct. So I'm thinking the $4k MQD's gives me 80% of the $50k extra spend I had last year.  And assuming 2025 is similar to 2024, around Oct 2025 I'd be roughly $1,000 MQD's short. Which I'd easily hit with card spend alone in Nov/Dec but I typically fly for Thanksgiving and Christmas as well so I'd have a good buffer if 2025 is a little light compared to 2024.

The main negative I see with using 2 choices on the MQD accelerator is that I end up not making DM next year so they'd basically be a waste since I'll hit PM for sure regardless. Versus the safer bet would be taking the $700 statement credit and the 35k bonus miles or $350 delta voucher.

1b2ocjh,2024-02-29 09:54:41,My Husband got Stuck in a Delta airplane bathroom for 35 minutes.,"So here‚Äôs a story for ya‚Äôll‚Ä¶you really can‚Äôt make this shit up!!

Additional videos/pics in comments.

On a recent Delta Air Lines flight from Salt Lake City to New Orleans, my husband, Brent, got up to use the bathroom, leaving me, my four year old and two year old in our row. No big deal, I knew I‚Äôd get my help with our two toddlers back in a jiffy.

After 5 minutes, I wondered what was going on. Was he using this time as a much-needed break from my children‚Äôs whiney demands and frequent tantrums? I didn‚Äôt blame him.

I shuffled the kids and I around, as this was taking longer than expected. If you know my kids, you know they don‚Äôt just sit still. So hanging them to myself on a long flight is a handful. Ten minutes went by, and as my 4-year-old asked yet again, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs daddy?‚Äù I heard a flight attendant say the word ‚Äústuck.‚Äù

Something clicked. ‚ÄúExcuse me, is there someone stuck in the bathroom??‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe door is jammed, and someone is stuck in there.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs my husband!‚Äù

My attention diverted to the rear of the plane, where sure enough, two Delta flight attendants were yanking the bathroom door handle in and attempt to free my trapped husband.

Soon, the two flight attendants (both women) recruited a random male passenger to help try to dislodge the door. He gave it his damnest, but it was to no avail.

It had now been 20 minutes. Brent had been stuck in a 3.5 x 5ft pee and poop box for almost a half hour.

Next up to try his luck, and I kid you not, was THE PILOT. Don‚Äôt ask me who was flying the plane LOL. I think they may have needed his permission to potentially damage the door to get Brent out. The pilot was really giving it is all, as you can see in the videos. But it wasn‚Äôt until Brent kicked the hell out of the door while the pilot was pulling as hard as possible that Brent finally made his escape.

1anm5k3,2024-02-11 01:58:32,Here‚Äôs why I always screenshot the upgrade and standby list,"So I‚Äôm making a tight connection in ATL heading out to the west coast and I don‚Äôt have enough time for something to eat. It‚Äôs a long enough flight that there‚Äôs meal service, and it‚Äôs actually Delta One style seats in first. Thankfully I‚Äôm number one on the list with three first class upgrades available, so odds are good for a nice seat and a decent meal. I take the screenshot as I‚Äôm deplaning and walk to the next gate. Ten minutes before boarding, I re-open the app to see that all three seats have been given away, but only one name is on the actual upgrade list. It was the name that was number three on the list. I ask the gate agent what happened, and she says ‚ÄúOh, she was first available on the upgrade list.‚Äù I show her the screenshot, no she wasn‚Äôt, she was number three. This goes back and forth for about two minutes and I give up. Before I walked away I said ‚ÄúDelta is really making it hard to stay loyal these days.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad I did, because a red coat was summoned. After discussing with the red coat, she goes to the gate agent. Gate agent admits that yes, the woman was number three on the list, but she had approached the gate agent said she ‚Äúwas having a rough day‚Äù and thus her request for a first class seat was granted. By the way, I passed the woman while boarding. She looked downright jovial, so it couldn‚Äôt have been that bad of a day.

What happened to the other two first class upgrades? Good question, because I looked on the standby list. I pointed out to the red coat that two people who seemed to have the same last name were about 2/3 the way down the list and got upgraded to first. The red coat talked to the gate agent, and it turns out they were a couple flying together, and the only way to have them seated together was to move them from standby to first class. Over the diamond member who was number one on the list. I didn‚Äôt even know jumping from standby to first class was possible.

So apparently simply asking for an upgrade or being a couple flying together on standby takes priority over all other upgrades. Did the screenshot help me at all? In the end, no, but at least it gave me the ammo to plead my case. And it did help me get the explanation of what actually happened, even as unsatisfying as the answer was.",TheNCGoalie,241,1772,delta

1g8y79j,2024-10-22 03:20:00,Downgraded to a cheaper flight - what to do next?,"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster.

**Preface**: I figured that this is something that would be easily resolved post-flight, but apparently that is not the case.

**Story**: I booked a round-trip flight in C+ and selected our seats. When booking, I had a choice of an afternoon flight or an early morning flight (7AM). The afternoon flight was measurably more expensive for obvious reasons. I booked the afternoon flight. About 2 months before the trip Delta cancelled the return flight and rebooked us to the early morning flight. At that point, booking a direct flight with another airline would've been significantly more expensive, and I preferred flying direct over connecting in another airport and adding hours to the return trip for a more convenient flight time.

Following the trip, I submitted a complaint about the fact that we got rebooked on a cheaper flight but were never compensated for the difference. The initial response I got was that I was wrong and that this was just a schedule change, which can happen and no compensation is offered for that. I replied that this was actually a rebooking because the original return flight (DL508) was rebooked to DL1015.  Both flights existed on the day I was booking and one was cancelled well ahead of time (side note - Delta flies both every day except for that day for some reason). I said that bare minimum we should be compensated for the fare difference. The response I got was:

&gt;...we will have to agree that we cannot find the right solution this time. Any further communication would not be productive and we will not respond again regarding this incident.

Am I in the wrong here? Am I expecting too much from Delta? Any suggestions on what to do next?

**Bonus annoyances**:

* On the rebooking we were separated to different rows. I called in hopes to resolve only to be told that this can only be resolved at the gate - which is easily was, so I'm not even sure why this is something the rebooking system couldn't account for on rebooking, but did waste a bunch of my time and stressed me out.
* Had to take an uber instead of public transit, because we now had to leave for the airport before 5AM, which is when train service starts.... so 10x the commute to airport price.",danigrim,9,2,delta

1g1e5ex,2024-10-12 00:40:22,Delta JFK seriously sucks now.,"A reminder for travelers.

Delta JFK T4 experience is very poor at this time, you are looking at an **\~2 hours from touch down to Manhattan.** There are several delay factors.

1. Touch down to getting a gate at JFK. For example, our SFO-JFK flight last night landed at 7:50pm, a 30 min early arrival, only having to wait until 8:30pm to get a gate and then deplane.
2. The long walk in T4 -&gt; no need for further explanation.
3. The construction of T4 -&gt; either shuttle bus to Uber, or get in the taxi line. Last night I waited for 20min for taxi. It's very inefficient, single line, 8 cab a time approach. The past 3 times when I landed after 8pm at JFK, I had to wait at least 15min for cab. Everyone looks exhausted in the line. (Cab/Uber including tips is around $95 to $150 one way easy)
4. One hour to Manhattan give or take.

Last night I debated if I should just to LIRR but obviously, this is not the best option for everyone if you have kids/older companion/lots of luggage, plus the transfers, and you still will look at an roughly 50min-1h total travel time including AirTran and your transfer in Manhattan.

I am close to 2MM and Platinum status, but the summer of 2023 broke me with Delta after terrible experiences in NYC and how badly they handled rebooking &amp; the storms. I downgraded my Reserve to Platinum &amp; am cancelling that when I use my certificate next month and before my renewal charge. Since then, I've just been buying first on United mostly and really enjoying that.

So now I have 76K rollover MQM. Should I use them to bump me to Platinum for 2025 (I have enough existing MQD) or turn them into 38K skymiles? I am leaning towards the 38K because that should cover a couple of mileage upgrades, which is all I care about. Platinum status is garbage. I'm never going to get upgraded on a flight I care about based on current experience with Platinum status. It's not particularly valuable to me to have a status that only gets me 1 dollar more whereas the 38K is a bird in the hand, since the status upgrades are very much a bird in the bush.

I'm convinced it's the right choice but my spouse thinks I'm nuts. What are other people doing?

18ei9n9,2023-12-10 01:19:40,Poor behavior has consequences,"First time in a while this has happened to me, was common in my 20s.  Waiting to board flight back home last night from Seattle.  I‚Äôm black, in my late 30s, sitting in first class as usual.  GA announces first class boarding.  Some (poorly dressed) random middle-aged white dude proclaims to me ‚Äúexcuse me, can I get by, this is first-only boarding right now, rows 1-5.‚Äù  The Diamond tags on my carry-ons, as well as my red-colored boarding pass, are clearly visible. I look at this racist moron, give him a piece of my mind, and stay in line in front of him.

Then - joy of joys - it turns out he is seated directly behind me for 5 hours.  I virtually never recline my seat in domestic first, but just for him, I thoroughly enjoy keeping it in max recline for the full duration of the flight.

Amazing what some people think they can get away with.  Always remember - behaving like a churlish, entitled idiot while traveling will often come back to you in a not so pleasant manner.

Few edits to clarify:
1.  This was definitely a jet (the A321) where a fully reclined seat impedes your space, even in first.
2.  Oh yes, I was extra petty.  I enjoyed returning my seat violently to fully upright to go to the bathroom, before returning it violently to fully reclined when I returned.  And I made a point of using the bathroom quite a bit.
3.  African Americans deal with micro-aggressions like this on the regular from morons who think we don‚Äôt belong in nice places.  We have dealt with it since childhood and we know it when we see it.  In this case it was clear that I was being racially profiled by this man - I was the only black person in first, the only person he singled out, and he passed by other people to get to me, without saying a word to them.  Please take note - many of us, having dealt with this crap our entire lives, are done putting up with your bullshit.  It‚Äôs not 1955 anymore.  Treat us poorly and it will be returned to you instantly.  We don‚Äôt give a damn about respectability politics, ‚Äúgiving the benefit of the doubt‚Äù, or being pleasant to you.
4.  Solidarity with the women and other minorities or folks who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt pass‚Äù who have had to tolerate this nonsense and poor treatment from entitled crusty old white men too ‚úäüèΩ
5.  The lesson?  Mind your own damn business and let the GAs do their job.  This prick didn‚Äôt, still boarded the plane behind me, and had a less pleasant flight as a result.

Last night our flight was delayed several times only to be cancelled after holding us at the gate for hours because the crew had apparently timed out.  Our plane was late leaving its previous destination and they held us at the gate telling us once it landed, we would board and our flight would go forward as planned (but substantially
late). It was not until the flight landed/arrived that they told us the crew had clocked out. 

They provided hotel vouchers but the hotel options were terrible (some had reviews of less than 3 starts on google). 

They provided meal vouchers but all food options in the airport were closed and the hotel restaurant did not take them.  

We barely slept, hotel was loud, etc.  

I‚Äôll add that our initial flight out a few days ago was delayed, had no air conditioning while we waited at the gate, and had non working WiFi. 

I was compensated with 10k points total. My girlfriend, to our knowledge, got nothing. 

Is this give or take max compensation for something like this?  We are really just exhausted and upset about this and I do not personally think 10,000 points is reasonable.

1g1c3el,2024-10-11 23:11:56,Another upgrade question - ATL to HND,"Hey folks,

My flight is about a week and a half out. Within the past few days, all the open D1 seats changed to X. PS is still available to purchase the upgrade on, but I wanted to check something first. 

Is it possible D1 will reopen to paid upgrades? Not looking for a free ride, and I know the algorithm may be difficult to predict. I know once you pay for an upgrade from Main to PS, you have to then call if you want to upgrade from PS to D1. I was hoping to avoid that.

Right now, PS is $500, and I'm considering it, but I didn't want to do that and then D1 reopens a few days later at a price I'm comfortable with.

Recently, my 11:15am flight from JFK to FLL was diverted to Dulles due to ‚Äúequipment problems.‚Äù We were originally supposed to land in FLL at 2:20pm, but after being told our replacement part was coming from Reagan, our new estimated departure was around 4pm.

169smsg,2023-09-04 21:54:40,Shamed on LAS - JFK,"A couple of months back, my toddler, husband  and I were flying back JFK from LAS on Delta after visiting family stationed in Vegas. I‚Äôm a platinum medallion and about two days before the flight we were upgraded to first. We fly a lot and my son is close to silver (happens when family is spread out around the country). My husband was on a separate reservation and in C+.

Anyway, we boarded the flight and I strapped the kiddo into his car seat and he was content watching Mickey on the screen. During boarding the woman across the aisle noticed I was there with my kid and made an audible groan and rolled her eyes then sat down. 

The flight was uneventful - my kid was a kid and got excited a few times throughout the flight reacting to something on the screen. My husband popped up a couple of times to check in. When my son got restless I got him up and we went all the way to the back of the plane where he entertained some FAs for a bit. Note - we went to the back as to purposely not disturb other first passengers. 

At one point I had my headphones on while getting some work done and my kid was watching some movie like cars or Toy Story - whenever he got vocal I took my headphones off and took care of him. 

Upon landing at JFK, my kid woke up and was upset. - he‚Äôs 2 and did pretty good to not scream or have a tantrum at all until we landed. Once at the gate, the woman who had groaned and rolled her eyes during boarding looked at her (I‚Äôm assuming husband) and said ‚ÄúThat awful kid didn‚Äôt shut up the entire (explicative) flight and that (explicative) dad just let us listen to it, they should be banned from first.‚Äù

I looked at her directly and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, was my toddler disturbing you?‚Äù She wouldn‚Äôt look at me or respond.

The couple behind us tapped me on the shoulder and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it, we have a three year old and your kid was great the entire flight - ignore her - if she says something else, we‚Äôve got your back.‚Äù

I was waiting for my husband to reach our row to help, the woman across the isle was deplaning then said just loud enough so I could hear ‚ÄúThis is exactly why two men shouldn‚Äôt be parents, they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and it‚Äôs not right.‚Äù

It took all my self control to ignore her - and I had to set that example for my son. Thankfully the flight attendant heard what was going on and asked if we were ok - I said I was shocked at the blatant homophobia and she clicked on the woman‚Äôs seat on her iPhone and started typing. 

I have no clue what the FA typed into her phone - but so thankful she recognized the woman‚Äôs inappropriate behavior and that it wasn‚Äôt ok. 

I fly weekly for work and the complimentary upgrades for being a platinum are a small benefit of it and I‚Äôm not going to be shamed or told by a passenger that my son and I don‚Äôt belong in first class - we‚Äôre paying customers just like her and have every right to be there.",seabass66207,376,1642,delta

Every chance you could, you made your own stink about it.  The smell didn't wake me,  but you sure did several times.

Wandering around the cabin and peering into people's suites who are trying to sleep while huffing and puffing and trying to ""out the farter"" was 100000xs more disruptive than the farter themself.

Having to yell at you for constantly spraying disgusting perfume in the cabin which I witnessed you do and which you tried to deny was the final insult.

People fart on planes, it's unpleasant but sometimes it happens to people when they fly. What was the plan once you found the culprit?  Shame them into not farting? Tossing them into the Atlantic?

But perhaps that‚Äôs just my experience lol. They are also constantly watching you even if you don‚Äôt think they are. If you do something slightly wrong count your days lmao jk but don‚Äôt do too much and don‚Äôt do too little. Always make yourself available to answer all questions during the group setting while you‚Äôre waiting for the next task to be given, apparently they like that. They say not to talk about the hiring process but I will say it was a lot of mumbo jumbo to be honest. The people that I thought would 100% get it (had previous flight attendant experience) were rejected so quickly. It‚Äôs so odd because you really don‚Äôt know how they hire people, it‚Äôs really just in the air and just by chance. They tell you things throughout the process that make you think you‚Äôre going to get hired just to sike you out lol. 
Annnndddd if they send you to the bus you‚Äôre rejected, despite if they say look at your email and make you think they‚Äôll hire you, no. (According to the people crying on the bus) Bus=not hired Staying behind=hired.
Though, I heard if you keep trying they will see that you are persistent and like that. I know somebody that tried 8 times until they finally got it.

Delta has recently opened Delta One lounges at JFK and LAX, with plans to expand to BOS, SLC, and SEA next. I can see why BOS made the list, given its decent number of Delta One international flights, and SEA makes sense due to the SkyTeam partner flights. But SLC? That one surprises me.

Honestly, DTW should absolutely be getting a Delta One lounge, and ATL definitely deserves one too. In fact, ATL probably needs the largest lounge‚Äîor even two of them‚Äîsince it's close to Delta‚Äôs headquarters and handles most of their international flights.

1ea5z77,2024-07-23 19:56:59,A Pilot's Perspective,"I'm going to have to keep this vague for my own personal protection but I completely feel, hear and understand your frustration with Delta since the IT outage. 

I love this company. I don't think there is anything remarkable different from an employment perspective. United and American have almost identical pay and benefit structures, but I've felt really good while working here at Delta. I have felt like our reliability has been good and a general care exists for when things go wrong in the operation to learn how to fix them. I have always thought Delta listened. To its crew, to its employees, and above all, to you, its customers. 

That being said, I have never seen this kind of disorganization in my life. As I understand our crew tracking software was hit hard by the IT outage and I first hand know our trackers have no idea where many of us are, to this minute. I don't blame them, I don't blame our front line employees, I don't blame our IT professionals trying to suture this gushing wound. 

I can't speak for other positions but most pilots I know, including myself, are mission oriented and like completing a job and completing it well. And we love helping you all out. We take pride in our on-time performance and reliability scores. There are 1000s of pilots in-position, rested, willing and excited to help alleviate these issues and help get you all to where you want to go. But we can't get connected to flights because of the IT madness. We have a 4 hour delay using our crew messaging app, we have been told NOT to call our trackers because they are so inundated and swamped, so we have no way of QUICKLY helping a situation. 

Recently I was assigned a flight. I showed up to the airport to fly it with my other pilot and flight attendants. Hopeful because we had a compliment of a fully rested crew, on-site, and an airplane inbound to us. Before we could do anything the flight was canceled, without any input from the crew, due to crew duty issues stemming from them not knowing which crew member was actually on the flight. (In short they cancelled the flight over a crew member who wasnt even assigned to the flight, so basically nothing) And the worst part is that I had 0 recourse. There was nobody I could call to say ""Hey! We are actually all here and rested! With a plane! Let's not cancel this flight and strand and disappoint 180 more people!"". I was told I'd have to sit on hold for about 4 hours. Again, not the schedulers fault who canceled  the flight because they were operating under faulty information and simultaneously probably trying to put out 5 other fires.

So to all the Delta people on this subreddit, I'm sorry. I obviously cannot begin to fathom the frustration and trials you all have faced. But us employees are incredibly frustrated as well that our Air Line has disappointed and inconvenienced so many of you. I have great pride in my fellow crew members and Frontline employees. But I am not as proud to be a pilot for Delta Air Lines right now. You all deserve so much better

She then stormed off &amp; chased the FA‚Äôs down until one came back &amp; demanded to see my ticket. I again showed her. The Mother continued to interject that I needed to move.

I've heard PS on an A350 is really nice, but D1 would obviously be even better. Being able to sleep is my biggest concern.

Any suggestions aside from keeping an eye on the app while assuming I probably won't see a lower price?",AssistancePretend668,8,0,delta

They said yes, and in the last 4 months I earned as many miles as I had in the last 6 years. (Spent all my miles last summer for my girlfriend‚Äôs milestone Birthday)

1am902l,2024-02-09 07:03:00,"Update: My Sweet, Oblivious Mother","I posted a few weeks ago about the fact that I had upgraded the ticket I had bought for my mom to visit me to first class, and after a couple of weeks she still hadn‚Äôt noticed it.

Well, oh mom, a week or so before she was supposed to visit me I called her and she said in a hushed tone, ‚ÄúI have to ask you this while your dad can‚Äôt hear me, I think I only have a ticket to visit you but not to return‚Äù. She had bought her own ticket out to Austin to see me on Southwest, and I‚Äôd bought her return ticket on Delta (best option for flying non-stop at sane hours). So even though I‚Äôd been asking if she‚Äôd gotten her confirmation email, and she‚Äôd been saying yes, she actually only had it for the trip out. I reminded her that I bought her ticket home on Delta. Still, she clearly doesn‚Äôt clock what I‚Äôve done.

Pick her up from the airport, and on the drive to my house she tells me she thinks there‚Äôs something wrong with her ticket for her return flight because she‚Äôs in first class. (I knew she‚Äôd think that!) I told her it wasn‚Äôt a mistake, I upgraded her ticket. She told me I shouldn‚Äôt have wasted money on her, and I said a) it was points, and b) it wasn‚Äôt a waste. She was very excited because she hadn‚Äôt flown first class since I was born (the sacrifices made for children), which I‚Äôd suspected. She had a great time in first. She also had a great visit. I took her to her favorite restaurants, to play Valentines bingo with my friends, and we volunteered at Garrison Brothers distillery where she got properly tipsy and got to hang out with cowboys (she loves Yellowstone).",smashes72,46,1323,delta

What's more, by having immediate clearance into D1 at booking, you can enjoy the Delta One lounge in T4 which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Waitlist for D1 won't get you in.

Yes, it's a clunky 767-300, but the seats still lie-flat and the crew I had when I flew to Prague last week to see the Devils open the season was one of the best I've had on Delta.  (Shout out to Mark and Jolene!)

Plenty of availability in 2025.  And if your travels take you outside of Czechia, it's a great base to head south to see any of the Alpine regions around Salzburg, Munich, Vienna, or nothern destinations like Warsaw or Berlin.  Great location!

1g8mik9,2024-10-21 18:35:14,Favorite lounge at JFK Terminal 4?,"Until today, I exclusively went to the Sky Club in Concourse B. But my flight was delayed 2 hours this morning so my partner and I decided to lounge hop.

So far, we‚Äôve checked out the Sapphire lounge and the Centurion. The Centurion apparently doesn‚Äôt open the second level until later in the day, so it was small and quite unimpressive.

The Sapphire (/Etihad) lounge, however, is fantastic. Fewer food options than the SkyClub but less ‚Äúcafeteria‚Äù style food, which was a nice change of pace.

We‚Äôre going to skip the Primeclass because it looks terrible, but next on the list (and final, I think) is the Virgin Clubhouse. Looks nice from the pictures ü§û

EDIT: Final verdict for our next visit:

1. If it‚Äôs before 7:30am, Virgin Clubhouse (after 7:30, the menu changed and they started charging for everything. Lattes went from free to $5.)
2. Sapphire/Etihad (unless we‚Äôre out of Priority Pass visits since it‚Äôs limited to one per year and we don‚Äôt have the Sapphire Reserve)
3. Centurion but only if the full lounge is open (this is mainly because we didn‚Äôt get to see it in full.)
4. SkyClub on Concourse B (just because it‚Äôs just bigger so less likely to have a seating issue - though this is a guess)
5. SkyClub on Concourse A

Once the Capital One lounge opens, I imagine it will rank relatively high on the list. Based on research &amp; feedback, sounds like Air India isn‚Äôt that great and neither is Primeclass. Though I‚Äôm guessing the existing Primeclass will go away once the Capital One lounge opens because it says Primeclass is operating it.",Tight_Couture344,29,8,delta

1e3huue,2024-07-15 08:50:01,Malevolent and petty Boston gate agent intentionally delayed my flight for nearly 3 hours today.,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Delta customer since 1990‚ÄîI still have my OG physical SkyMiles card from when I was an infant!‚Äîand I‚Äôve stuck by their side even though they‚Äôve done me dirty time and time again. I have never been compelled to post about a Delta experience on the internet until today. So fasten your seats belts and secure your tray tables because you‚Äôre in for a bumpy ride. 

I was on flight 5682 today from Boston to DCA. The flight was scheduled to depart at 2:25 pm. Around 1:45, we heard an announcement saying the plane was there and we should expect an on time boarding and departure. By 2:15, we still hadn‚Äôt started boarding. The gate agent made an announcement that the flight was delayed for a minor mechanical issue. Apparently a tray table wasn‚Äôt locking and they had to fix it. We were like, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt they get some duct tape and call it a day?‚Äù but alas it seemed like a quick fix and we‚Äôd be on our way soon. 

We started boarding around 2:45. By 3:30, we still hadn‚Äôt pushed back from the gate. Apparently there were bags in the jet bridge that weren‚Äôt loaded on the plane. This is also the first time we caught wind of some sort of standoff between the gate agent and the flight crew/pilot. The plane finally pushed back from the gate around 3:45. Our joy was short lived. 

We idled adjacent to the gate for approximately 45 minutes without any indication as to why. The pilot announced that the gate agent had reported a loose screw and we had to go back to the gate for maintenance to check it out. Dismayed, we traveled the approximately 100 feet back to the gate. You might be wondering how the gate agent stationed in the terminal building was aware of a loose screw on the plane. Trust me, we all had that same question. The justification for turning back made no sense, but we were at Delta‚Äôs mercy. 

Once we arrived at the gate, the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off and we could move around the cabin. My cousin went to the bathroom and, while waiting in line, heard the scoop from one of the flight attendants. Apparently the gate agent wanted a flight attendant to ‚Äúmove‚Äù (we‚Äôre not sure what that means. Move to a different flight? Move to a different city? If anyone can enlighten me, please do) and she refused. The gate agent got annoyed with the flight attendant‚Äîwho was also celebrating her birthday today!‚Äîand decided to take it out on every single passenger and crew member of our flight not to mention subsequent passengers and crews impacted by the nearly 3 hour delay by intentionally delaying our flight. Maintenance came on, said there was never anything wrong with the plane, but of course we had to sit there forever anyway because they presumably had to fill out paperwork etc. when something like that is reported. We are wondering whether the gate agent intentionally falsified the tray table issue, deliberately refused to load the suitcases in the jet bridge on the plane, AND  made a false maintenance complaint of a loose screw to get back at this flight attendant. 

All told, we were 153 minutes delayed. The subsequent flight from DCA to JFK was also several hours delayed based on what I observed leaving the plane. The flight crew and pilot were all wonderful despite the situation. I can only hope that Delta fires this malicious, petty employee as a result of this incident. To intentionally falsify a safety issue to get back at a colleague is unprofessional. The only real loose screw here is the loose screw in the gate agent‚Äôs head. ",sneezykoi,213,1136,delta

I am not in shape. As soon as we hit 10k feet, I took my garbage bag and threw up in the bathroom. I dunno why but I always lose my lunch after having to run. Thankfully the gate agent called me and I told her I was on the way, running to the gate. Made it before the 15 minute mark. 

Flight attendant put on full gear. Gown, mask, gloves etc. I didn‚Äôt make it all into the trash bag. But mosty into it. A little on the floor.  Also the sink backed up when I washed my hands. 

Anyway they couldn‚Äôt put it in the trash so I got a little red biohazard bag and the FA made me put it under my seat. It was weird. Never had a biohazard bag under my seat before.

Departure from MAD was further delayed. We left about 2 1/2 hours after the aircraft arrived.  Probably not a bad turnaround for an international flight.  We certainly don‚Äôt want them to skimp on cleaning the interior and restocking.

Flight attendants were great.  Very attentive and friendly.  Not sure I‚Äôve been offered water as many times in 9 1/2 hours as we were this time.

After a lot of complaining, we got booked on KLM, but only with economy seats and no help on how to get an equivalent class of service, even though there was availability.

3. You do have slightly better food, but not crazy better than MC. 

4. They do give you a nice little memory foam pillow that also seems useless because your seat doesn‚Äôt recline enough to make using a pillow that useful.(Unless you are short AF like my wife and can curl up and use it to lay down on the armrest) I did use it for extra back support at different times though.

1g7eoch,2024-10-20 01:59:00,Companion Certificate w/Card Upgrade ,"I have a question for those of you that have upgraded your Delta Skymile AmEx CC to get a companion certificate. 

I upgraded my Gold card to a Reserve card back in July. The way I justified the high annual renewal fee is because of the companion certificate that was supposedly given with each fee.

I have been watching for my cocompanion certificate in my Delta app since then and because it never appeared I wrote to AMEX customer service. They have informed me that apparently since my card anniversary (when I originally got my Gold card) is in April, that when I upgraded to the reserve card in July, that the fee was prorated to $453.40 from the regular annual fee of $750. So because of this I will not be getting a companion certificate until I pay the next renewal fee of $750 in April.

Personally I would have rather had been charged the full $750 and recreceived the companion certificate. Since I didn't get a companion certificate I feel like I was scammed out of the $453.40.

I was wondering what the rest of your experiences are with card upgrades in regards to this? ",EgoExplicit,8,0,delta

190s52q,2024-01-07 21:27:34,Seated Next to Passenger ‚Äúof size‚Äù. Experience?,"Flew a short regional flight in the Midwest last week. I was seated in Comfort+, next to an individual who was impeding on space/seat due to what I can only describe as their morbid obesity. They were talking up their seat, and 50% of my seat. The were using a seatbelt extender, which I‚Äôm shocked was large enough to work. The middle arm rest could not be lowered. I am a broad shouldered,  large man myself- I stay in shape and am not obese. I always pay for First Class tickets on longer flights, and at a minimum Comfort+ on shorter flights. Suffice to say, space was limited. 

I notified the flight attendant immediately, did not make a scene, and kept the conversation private. I did not want to shame this person or create an issue. Nobody deserves that- and I will never assume circumstances of a stranger. She shared that nothing could be done due to the flight being full. We then embarked on the flight, and it was terrible. 

Needless to say, I am very frustrated with the experience. I paid extra for a Comfort+ seat, and it was an extremely uncomfortable flight- regardless of duration. Without even considering the inherent safety issues.

I only fly Delta if possible. However, this is the last of a string of experiences that have left me to conclude Delta has reduced in quality to those of their competitors- and am now paying a premium for a budget experience. 

Anyone else have experience with this? I‚Äôve reached out to their customer support, and a complaint/case has been opened. Any input would be appreciated.

EDIT: Delta isn‚Äôt doing anything to resolve this‚Ä¶ Disappointing. Their response below: 


I wanted to personally reach out to you regarding your recent flight with Delta Airlines. Your comfort and satisfaction are of utmost importance to us, and I understand that your recent flight may not have met your expectations due to the situation you encountered onboard.

I understand there was a passenger of size seated next to you, and their presence resulted in an encroachment into your seat space. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience you experienced. We understand that this can be frustrating, and it falls short of the comfortable and enjoyable travel experience we aim to provide to all our passengers.

At Delta, we are fully committed to providing safe and accessible travel to all passengers, including those who may require additional accommodations due to their size. We want to emphasize that our policies adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other applicable laws, which ensure equal rights and accessibility for all travelers.

It's disappointing to hear that you were not able to be accommodated in another seat due to the aircraft being full, though unfortunate this incident is not considered a Delta Air Lines service failure. 

Delta will not prohibit persons of size from traveling or deny boarding based on a person's weight.  While we encourage larger customers to purchase more than one seat, requiring it runs contrary to Delta's core value of inclusion. Please know that we stand by our relentless commitment to treat all customers equally, with dignity and respect.  Nevertheless, we sincerely regret how this inconvenience has impacted your travel experience.

Delta does not discriminate or condone discrimination of any person or group for any reason.  We are privileged to serve thousands of customers from around the world every day and are committed to treating everyone fairly and as equally as possible.  While our crew works hard to provide excellent customer service to everyone onboard, we are sensitive to your experience and sincerely regret any inconvenience this may have caused.

Once again, I apologize for the inconveniences you faced during your recent travel with us. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve, and we thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

Booked this trip and picked the exit row with the ability through status. Checked in at origin airport and got paper copies of my tickets ( thank God), still shows exit row seat I booked. Landed at layover and app still showed the seat I booked.

Connection starts boarding. Open app and see my seat changed, I'm 4 rows up from where I booked now. Not in an exit row any longer. Went and interrupted the ticket agent and asked if there was an equipment change (I could tell there wasn't already). He said no, so I pulled out my paper ticket and asked why I was bumped out of my seat without permission and to please look at me for why I need the exit row and booked it intentionally. 

I was firm but polite. He stopped boarding when he realized this could start to be a major customer service issue and went back the the computer. Made a statement about how it couldn't be changed because the people in the exit row were there as a group. I reminded him I had a paper copy that shows I had the seat first. 

He caved and put me back in the seat I booked right then. And yes it caused an issue during boarding when that group did the ""you are in my seat sir"" and the FA had to use her pad to verify the seat assignments. 

Frankly I don't like to have to get firm with customer service agents. I know they get enough Karen's everyday. But in years of flying Delta I've never been bumped out of my seat to accommodate some other groups request to sit together.

Is this a common occurrence now? Is this the new Delta? Do I have a right to be agitated or not?

EDIT. wow glad I'm not crazy for being upset. Should I call customer service to complain?
Also to answer the question, no the row they tried to move me too was not comfort+ nor first class. It at least was window to window seat, just no legroom. 

EDIT EDIT. Well this blew up. Guess this happens too often or struck a nerve with travelers all around. So some timeline. Wrote this waiting for taxi departure right after the event. Checked on it when i landed so decided to try and talk to a CS agent / redcoat at the relatively small/mid final dest airport. The gate agent were nice, i told my story, they said they don't have a delta CS desk at that airport and the best i could do was talk to the ticket counter and ask for a manager, but they though the Platinum reservation line would be better. 

Platinum line told me to file a compliant. Delta twitter told me to file a complaint. I file a compliant and get..... 15k miles. Woot i guess? Seems low when a broken TV or some turbulence gets you half of that, usually automatically. 

Anyway i'm done with it. The group that tried to steal my seat were a handful of retired older ladies. The ones that stayed next to me were nice and we had some nice conversations. Got to my dest and went straight to work without injured legs, which would have been the case in the seat they tried to put me in.

‚ÄúI really prefer my seat.‚Äù

Due to a family emergency our family had to grab the last five seats on four legs. (Yes, it was insanely expensive for an already pricey route we do frequently. Several times, even with main cabin and platinum status I had to split us up all over the plane. Keep in mind it‚Äôs myself, my wife, our 6 y/o, our 16 month old infant in-lap, and our older exchange student. 

The gates did the best job trying to pull us together or at least close but for one flight we had window, middle, window in the same row. As we boarded and approached our row, I see a petite woman in the aisle seat and I ask her, ‚Äúhi, we‚Äôre traveling as a family. We have this window seat just on the other side of the plane. Do you like the aisle or would it be possible for me to switch with you so that I can sit with my wife and daughter and our son in her lap?‚Äù I know fully well that my son is ready for nap time and this flight is going to be a little painful to start with him being fussy. She says, ‚ÄúI really prefer my seat.‚Äù While slightly disappointed I say, ‚ÄúThank you. I understand. I definitely prefer the aisle too.‚Äù And then I squeeze over two gentlemen who look like seasoned flyers and find my window seat. 

The two guys see this interaction and look a little puzzled. I look over at them and say, ‚ÄúI get it, but I‚Äôm not sure she knows what she‚Äôs getting herself into.‚Äù The two gentlemen look at each other, nod, and go, ‚ÄúYeah, we get it. Hold on. Steve, let‚Äôs switch with his wife and kids.‚Äù They call to my wife and say, ‚Äúplease switch with us. We don‚Äôt mind. And it looks like you‚Äôve got your hands full.‚Äù 

THANK GOD!

Our six seats shuffle. The woman who rightfully want to keep her seat did. Our family chaos was contained to one side of the plane to bother everyone a whole lot less. And these two guys benefitted from us being able to double team the travel-worn kids without much hassle. 

As someone who travels a lot with a pack and individually I want to thank all involved including the woman who stood her ground. She might have needed that seat or she may have just wanted it and that‚Äôs ok too. 

Flying with an infant is already stressful and anxiety producing. I‚Äôm just glad it turned out ok. Due to exit rows and small planes, the next flight did not go quiet as well, but that‚Äôs life.

The flights are in December and both flights are empty for first class. All seats available for both flights, entire flight is pretty much empty as of today. 

I called delta yesterday to use my certificates and they told me the seats were ‚Äúsold out‚Äù and I would be put on priority list with RUC.

But when I check the app I can purchase any of the seats in first class and the flight is almost 2 months from now.

These RUC expire in January and I won‚Äôt be flying any other time between now and then so I want to make sure they get used. 

Is this the new normal with RUCs?  ",frankocean0101,13,3,delta

1. Take a photo of your license plate 
2. Take note of where pay stations are located level 4
3. When you return, use the pay station to pay for parking or use the App. Pay station uses your license plate to calculate your fee. 
4. At the exit, stop and do not cross the huge red stop line until car ahead exits. 
5. Tailgating causes license plate camera blockage and a log jam. 
6. Peach pass works most commonly of the time but is prone to outages. 
7. Lazy uninformed drivers/travelers stay away from ATL West, use park and ride.

1g5w7z7,2024-10-18 01:21:36,MQDs from rebooked AF flight not posting,"I booked two DL-marketed, AF-operated flights (GVA-CDG, CDG-LAX) for 9 October through delta.com. The morning of, AF cancelled my first flight, but very quickly and very helpfully auto-rebooked me on two later flights that day. The first was still AF-operated, but the second was now a DL-operated flight (bummer‚ÄîI was looking forward to trying the AF business class product instead of D1). When I tried to board my flight out of CDG, the scanner kicked up an error message, and it took the GA a good 10 minutes to pull my reservation in and get me on the plane. The reprinted BP had something on it like ‚ÄúFLT COUPON NEEDED - DOCS OK‚Äù. When I boarded, there was one of those little notes from the FA waiting for me at my seat, so Delta clearly knew I was supposed to be on the flight!

A few days after landing, the MQDs from the first flight posted as expected. But the second flight shows as 0 MQDs in my account. I‚Äôm used to partner airline flights taking a few days to post, but when they do, they invariably seem to have the right number of MQDs attached to them. When I called the PM number, the agent says they‚Äôre still waiting on ‚Äúverification‚Äù from AF and that the MQDs are just pending. But since the flight has actually posted to my account and since DL IT is notoriously glitchy, I am of course immensely skeptical. 

This is the flight that will push me over the hump to DM, so I‚Äôm obviously eager for it to post to my account. Am I just being overly anxious here, or should I call DL back and see if there‚Äôs more that should be happening?",jhartvu,2,1,delta

About an hour and a half into the flight, the pilot comes out of the cockpit to take a whiz and is chatting up the flight attendant. All of sudden he goes completely white, passes out, and collapses into the beverage cart kicking in over. He was completely pale and was unconscious. Luckily there were two doctors also sitting right there in first class and jumped up to help him. 

He regained consciousness pretty quick, maybe 15-20 seconds and luckily was ok. They checked all his vitals and it sounded like he just passed out from low blood sugar/didn‚Äôt eat that morning. 

We made an emergency landing into Omaha and credit to Delta because they flew in an entirely new flight crew and we were back in the air en route to SFO in less than 4 hours. They also catered lunch for us in the terminal.

Did the interview and got the CJO for their Atlanta location. Sent my background info and the next day I went and did my drug test. Now to be upfront I only had stopped smoking about a month before this but just stopped cold turkey during a vacation. Checking the portal it said my background was in progress for the longest so i assumed background but friday I got a phone call from the MRO saying i tested positive for weed. I was surprised because I had taken a drug test for a different company literally the week before and they cleared me with no issues so I'm still wondering how I even passed that one and failed this one but the day after the MRO my application goes from ""background in progress"" to ""completed not selected"" i assumed that meant they withdrew the CJO. However about an hour ago the recruiter calls me and tells me they want to send me to the Utah location instead and theyre gonna try to get paperwork done by tomorrow so I can recieve my start date.

Rolled into my 1 Bravo seat late in account I don't carry on bags and was enjoying some friendly chit chat with someone in the lounge. I board in time for my PDB standard of a triple-double bloody mary with a sweetwater 420 chaser. I noticed seated next to me is an 8ish year old.  I say hi. 


He looks at my watch, says it's not a replica but a full on shitter fake. 

Me: Hu? 

Kid: Your watch, it's fake.

Me: (checks the time) Nope, it's real and it's 09:17 hours. 

Kid: why isn't the second hand moving?

Me: it's a chronograph, the second hand his here. ( I point at the 6 o'clock dial on my Omega Speedmaster) and show him if I press this button it moves and this dial at 2 o'clock stops on the 10th of a second.

The poor girl beside her pointed out blood on the aisle armrest to the flight attendant before we took off, but was brushed off with a ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want to sit there, you can fly tomorrow.‚Äù 

That was until we were a half hour into the flight, 16A got up to go to the bathroom, and there was a pool of blood in her seat. When the flight attendants asked if she was ok, she said something along the lines of ‚Äúyeah this happens all the time and started this morning, my son will take me to the hospital when we get to Portland.‚Äù 

This was compounded by the fact that her cat kept shitting in its carrier. Rows 14-18 were given masks and bags of coffee grounds to cover the stench. Some of us stood in the back galley for about an hour to 1) avoid the smell, and 2) give the nurses room to determine whether the nonplussed walking biohazard needed to be treated immediately. 

Eventually they diverted us to Kansas City where she was deplaned, complaining that she had never before experienced ‚Äúsuch a nuisance.‚Äù She also asked the flight attendant to allow the cat to continue on to Portland, but luckily they both left the plane together. 

So just a little PSA: please don‚Äôt board a flight if you‚Äôre bleeding uncontrollably.

I have been taking about 6 shorter (1.5hr-3 hr) flights a month for the past 3 months after work upped my travel from 2 flights a month.

## TIMELINE OF EVENTS

This all happened on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2024. All timestamps are in local time.

# Less relevant part but still worth mentioning:

**12:05 PM - Cabo Airport:** I flew to Atlanta from San Jos√© del Cabo (Flight 1848, departed at 12:02 PM).  
I collect miles through a partner airline, so I do not wish to sign up for Delta's SkyMiles. I therefore purchased an in-flight WiFi pass, which worked right away, even before taking off (and not only at 10,000 feet like others have mentioned, or like it might sometimes be).  
Nothing else worth noting, flight went normally, and I used the WiFi the whole time.

You can see the charge for the first in-flight WiFi pass [here](https://i.imgur.com/lUqs48H.png) ([detail](https://i.imgur.com/1TYNVzK.png) - in Cabo time this would be 12:18).

*NOTE: I generated this virtual card recently, and I had been using it sporadically for specific, potentially unsafe purchases such as this one. But never did I at ANY point use it for purchases in USD except for the Delta WiFi passes.*

**7:15 PM - Atlanta Airport:** 2-hour layover. I used the WiFi in the Delta Skyclub, which is password protected.

# Relevant details:

**08:55 PM - Atlanta Airport:** I board Flight 2416 to Montreal (departed at 09:16 PM). I'm chronically online, so as soon as I sit down, I try to buy a WiFi pass like on my earlier flight (which had worked instantly, and I was able to use it even before takeoff), but the authentication page isn't loading. When tapping the ""Sign-in to network,"" it redirected me to the landing page that tells you to copy and paste the URL deltawifi.com, which in turn redirects you to wifi.delta.com, but it only shows ""Loading..."" with a spinner.

**09:38 PM - Onboard Flight 2416:** The authentication page finally loads and, since I earn miles through a partner airline of Delta, I don't want to sign up for a SkyMiles account, so I decide (once more) to purchase a WiFi pass ([detail](https://i.imgur.com/M5CNYEe.png)). Everything seems to be working normally, but the previous slow loading made me turn on my VPN.

**10:02 PM - Onboard Flight 2416:** Fourteen minutes after completing the purchase of the WiFi pass, I get a US$39.37 charge from a Panda Express in California ([detail](https://i.imgur.com/TfO8BFB.png)). I'm extremely cautious about my online purchases and watch every notification that comes through my phone, so I noticed this charge right away. As I open my bank app to check the charge, I get another one.

**10:03 PM - Onboard Flight 2416:** A US$250 gift card purchase ([detail](https://i.imgur.com/i0eh8UL.png)) removed any doubt that it was malicious, so I blocked the card right away and immediately charged back the previous purchases. The gift card was immediately refunded, and the Panda Express refund is pending.  
The hacker tries to purchase another gift card at the same timestamp, this time US$518 ([detail](https://i.imgur.com/vdEvdfz.png)), but the card is already blocked by now, so it fails.

**10:04 PM - Onboard Flight 2416:** The hacker ""pings"" the disabled credit card, probably just to check whether it still works ([detail](https://i.imgur.com/S7n97lQ.png)).

**10:14 PM - Onboard Flight 2416:** The WiFi spoofer at least had to have been present on the flight, so I pretended to use the lavatory at the back of the plane. While walking there, I only noticed ONE person that looked suspicious and wasn't either watching a movie, sleeping, or playing a video game.  
The guy was on an Android phone and was looking around when I got up. As I walked by him and he noticed me, he quickly pressed the home button on his Android phone, but then as I walked past, he went back into a messaging app, which looked like WhatsApp. I slowed down and saw this guy was discussing personal details with someone else through the messaging app and either receiving or giving instructions. I saw the word ""Connecticut?"" and a list of personal details.

**10:17 PM - Onboard Flight 2416:** I walk back to my seat from the back lavatory, this time with my phone in hand, trying to film this guy. I was only able to film him browsing the ""YourAnonNews"" page on Twitter ([video](https://i.imgur.com/R1XXINH.mp4)). I was able to find the chart he was looking at [here](https://x.com/YourAnonNews/status/1830755706762358887/photo/1).

*NOTE: I* ***know*** *none of this is substantial proof against the guy, but all the clues I gathered point to him at least being the spoofer. Believe me when I say absolutely nobody else looked suspicious but him.*

**11:54 PM - Montreal Airport:**  
I land in Montreal and wait around for a bit to see if I'd see the guy come around and just observe his body language, but he was nowhere to be seen. It did seem like he waited to get off the plane last. I ran out of time to waste and had to go.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

To those saying that it wouldn't be worth it to do all of this just to ""steal some credit card numbers"", I do think it's lucrative to even steal one person's payment details if they don't react quickly, on top of all the SkyMiles accounts they can steal miles from. A US$200 flight isn't expensive if there's potentially thousands to be made and barely any chance to get caught. Look at all the comments here accusing me of lying, making this up, or saying it's not possible. It's clearly an easy crime to get away with.",PainAuNutella,553,1179,delta

No Delta Rep in sight. The Customs officers (whose title I don‚Äôt know so I‚Äôll use military rank description for the rank symbols I saw): 1 Colonel, 1 LTC, 1 Major and a handful of frontline agents were incredible. The agents were pissed, but polite to all the passengers, and I heard them repeatedly ask for a Delta rep to come down, to no avail.  They kept us updated by saying (something to the effect of); ‚Äòsorry folks, we don‚Äôt know why they sent you here, they shouldn‚Äôt have and they know better‚Äô and whatnot.

After 30-40 minutes the Customs agents led us through global entry where we had to go through TSA.  For the second time today. Remember, this was a domestic originated flight. A number of people missed their connections, a lot of confusion and running to make a connection.

1g3qy72,2024-10-15 05:12:40,RUC Question,"First-time platinum here and I elected to take RUCs as my benefit. In reading the language (and, yes, I've dug into all the T&amp;Cs; I also searched this sub and googled a bunch), the RUCs seem to only be applicable for upgrades one class above the fare class *purchased*. That word ""purchased"" seems particularly critical. That language implies that to get upgraded to FC, you must pay for C+. But why would a PM ever choose to pay for C+, since one of the benefits is the instant C+ upgrade. You'd have to be throwing money‚Äîoften, hundreds of dollars‚Äîat C+ seats, which you'd get for free anyway, in the \*hope\* of getting  upgraded. Am I understanding this correctly?  
  
This seems maybe like an obvious question, but it also seems like the system is a bit flawed if it's true. Or am I misunderstanding and the instant C+ upgrade makes PMs eligible to use their RUCs for FC?

Call Delta and it‚Äôs a 45 min wait to talk to someone so I schedule a callback.

But don‚Äôt worry, talk to the gate agent tomorrow and they‚Äôll fix it. How? They‚Äôre going to build a new seat out of tinker toys? Either there are seats available or not.

I checked in my bag at the gate and when I landed, it looked like the picture below. A wheel was missing, the zipper was busted, and items were missing/damaged. The baggage claim representative at the airport opened a ticket and asked me to fill out a lengthy and useless baggage claim form for lost/damaged baggage. I told him about the missing item and torn clothes, which happened to be a suit, tie, and dress shoes.  The representative at baggage claim reassured me this would not be a problem, and I naively believed him.

I waited almost 4 weeks for my first email acknowledging the claim form. The claims manager only acknowledged the bag‚Äôs value, but completely disregarded any of my actual clothes. All of which I spent at least an hour filling out on their form.  After my reply asking for compensation for both the luggage itself and the damaged/missing items,  it took another 2-3 weeks for a reply. I had to repeatedly contact the customer service team, which was useless, to find out that they didn‚Äôt receive my reply, couldn‚Äôt contact the claims manager, and there was no record of damaged clothes in my file.

This has left me extremely frustrated and it feels like no one I have talked to actually cares about trying to help me. At this point, I‚Äôm not sure what my options are or what I should even do. All I can say for sure is this has left a terrible impression on the company Delta has become.

  
TLDR: Delta destroyed my bag and damaged/lost a few of my clothes in the bag and they are only trying to compensate me for the bag itself (which is the least valuable part). What should I do?

This was my second time flying on Delta's Premium Select and I chose it specifically because I didn't want to spend the money on Korean Air's business class but also didn't want to sit in Korean Air's economy cabin. Compared with economy on Korean Air or Air Canada's premium economy, I thought Delta was significantly better at roughly the same price.

I took this exact flight on the exact same route a year ago so, thinking back, boarding was far more orderly and without the gate lice phenomenon you so often see. I think they specifically called it out at the gate. The food was great, particularly the French toast they served for breakfast, and the entertainment options were far better than what Korean Air offers, which matters on a flight approaching 15 hours. The slippers, toothbrush, lip balm and sleeping mask were a nice touch. On Air Canada, the premium economy bag is a grocery store totebag with a single item (slippers?). The headphones on Delta were also quite comfortable.

The real highlight of the trip was the flight attendant we had, Pete, who was the best flight attendant I've had in around 700,000 lifetime miles and made Premium Select feel like business class. So thank you, Pete! Whatever it is they pay you, it's not enough.

I did take Korean Air onwards to a destination in Southeast Asia, so I had a direct point of comparison. The seats on Delta are bigger, but Korean Air economy blows any North American airline's economy section out of the water with the exception of its limited entertainment choices. The overhead room on Korean Air is neverending, but the food was so-so (the bibimbap used to come with a small bowl of soup) and the last six hours of my journey were not as comfortable as the first 15.

If I had one complaint about Delta, it would be the app. I couldn't scan my passport to check in online and I couldn't get the email link or the app to accept my meal choice. It didn't matter because Premium Select offers Sky Priority access, but on the wrong day in the wrong airport, this could've been a real disaster.

I know fights are always iffy but they do run on time the majority of the time and an hour+ is plenty of time to absorb a short delay and make it from even the two farthest points in JFK terminal 4.  Is this correct reasoning?

In a world where the price of avocados fluctuates more than my will to hit the gym, Amex decides to weigh down our wallets even more!

So here's my grand plan ‚Äì I'm cancelling my card. That's right, Amex, prepare for your downfall! I can see it now: the headlines scream, ""Local Hero Cancels Card, Amex Declares Bankruptcy!"" It'll be chaos in the streets, stock markets plummeting, executives weeping into their overpriced lattes. Because surely, my one cancellation will be the straw that breaks the corporate camel's back. 

Imagine the scene at Amex headquarters: alarms blaring, people running around in panic. ""We didn't foresee this!"" they'll cry. ""How could we lose such a valued customer?"" they'll wail. Board meetings will be held, emergency strategies devised, all to win back the heart and wallet of yours truly. 

But no, it's too late. I have decided to take my vast financial influence elsewhere. Perhaps to a company that understands the value of a dollar, or at least the value of not charging an arm and a leg for the privilege of spending my own money.

I was hoping they‚Äôd deny him boarding because I really wanted to sleep. Unfortunately they let him on. As soon as I got on I found myself just three rows behind him in FC. At least he bought a FC ticket but he only had one and the dog was too large for even that. Plus, again, he was barking regularly.

Eventually a redcoat got on and I saw him go talk to the FAs and the captain. He then went and told the man that he needed to talk to him off the plane. The guy protested briefly but within a minute or so he got off. I could hear the dog barking while on the jetway for several minutes as they talked. Eventually a GA came on and got the man‚Äôs bag out of the overhead. They then upgraded a woman out of the back and I could see her summon a FA.

Just wanted to relay this story from last night. I was connecting from Asia through ATL and was already delayed a day out of Asia, and I expected ATL to be a shit show and... Well yeah. 

Most flights were already delayed, many cancelled, but my 10pm flight still showed good when I landed in ATL at 3pm so I figured I'd wait it out. 

As expected, flight finally posted as delayed at around 930, with 11pm departure.

At 1130pm, none of our scheduled crew was available, but a whole other crew assembled at the gate, not the original crew, but the captain and FO were good for the equipment and the FAs, though off-duty, were all still good and volunteered their time to get the flight out. 

I parked myself in a chair by the gate and watched and listened as the crew and FAs fought on the phone at the gate with DL scheduling for 2 hours, one crew times out, another walks up to gate and says ""We'll fly this plane"", volunteer FAs say ""we're going to staff this flight as volunteers.""

After another hour of them arguing on the gate phone with DL (it's around 2am now), they finally seem to get things settled and the crew goes down the jet bridge to prep the plane. 

30 minutes later, just as we are about to start boarding, DL calls the gate and says they can't leave because one of the FAs ISNT IN UNIFORM. So this flight attendant, after trying to find a uniform to borrow for 15 minutes, runs back up to the gate desk to call DL and plead her case, then the rest of the FAs come up to help, and the jet bridge door closes behind them. Gate agent says she's not going to open the jet bridge door because DL says the crew isn't registered in the flight properly because of the 'technicality'.

Then, it happened. This HERO FA mumbles something like 'This is not going to happen on my watch' and makes a call on her cell phone.

3 minutes later, A RAMP WORKER blasts through the jet bridge door from the air side and LITERALLY shouts ""If y'all want to go to XXX, then GET ON THE PLANE NOW"" 

At that point, the non-uniformed FA scrambles down the jet bridge, gate attendant HANGS UP on DL scheduling, and makes the announcement at 3am ""Ladies and gentlemen, GET ON THE PLANE NOW. ALL ROWS ALL ZONES JUST GET ON THE PLANE""

We were wheels up at 330am and now I'm at home on Reddit. 

Thanks, DL crew and gate workers. I tried to be vague about flight info because I got the sense that they are going to be reprimanded for their actions, but 130 of us on that flight all see you guys as HEROES! ",gcijeff77,246,8207,delta

I purchased an initial, main cabin, ticket on Delta flight xxxx to Paris, at price YYYY. After not receiving any confirmation email, and being curious, I went over to the Virgin website and booked there, plus ZZZZ to get their upgrade to better seats. Confirmation emails were received.



Later when I looked at my credit card bill, I saw both went through, and at the same, higher, price. The next day I called Delta to cancel my ticket on their end, but instead of cancelling, they somehow connected them.



After two more phone calls and a LONG chat with a Virgin rep I finally got Delta to make the cancellation &amp; refund. HOWEVER. In that 30 + day time frame, somehow my ticket got rebooked and I lost my seat in the comfort/delight area, and no one had any explanation for why or how it happened, just, ""gee, sorry.""

We were in Orlando and due to some family emergencies had to end our trip short. This made us change flights (6 of us). Because of the short notice we weren‚Äôt seated together. 

Got to MCO the hell hole and somehow TSA pre was dropped off my wife‚Äôs ticket. I took the kids through TSA with me and she went through regular security. Normally not much of a difference, but this time I was waiting forever - it was getting close to boarding time so I sent her text to meet me at the gate and I took everyone else. We got there and the plain was half boarded.  We got in line and I‚Äôm trying to call my wife and see how close she is. She hasn‚Äôt even made it to the TSA agents to check her boarding pass yet. I get on the plane with the kids and the FA could just see the stress on my face and asked what was going on. I told her about my wife and the pilot popped his head out and asked what was going on. At this point my wife calls and says she is through security and waiting for the plane train. He turned to me and said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry - we aren‚Äôt leaving Momma in Orlando.‚Äù Turns around back into the cockpit and says to his copilot - ‚Äúwe better go through this checklist one more time just to be sure.‚Äù  

At this point my wife makes it onto the plane a sweaty mess at ten minutes to departure. They held the door five minutes for her and the flight still left on time. This isn‚Äôt the end though. Because of our emergency flight switch we were all separated middle seats and one of my kids was a 5 year old. Stranger was super kind and switched so my wife could sit by our 5 year old. I tried to see if I could get anyone else to switch, but no dice and I didn‚Äôt push it because we were middle seats and I didn‚Äôt have a better seat to trade. I also had a 9 year old daughter and the FA saw she was sitting between two adult males and didn‚Äôt like that. I was about 6 rows behind her. She asked the person in the middle seat in front of me if they would switch with my daughter and he agreed. So she moved my daughter to the row in front of me and then told me that one of the guys she was seated next to gave her creeper vibes and was giving my daughter weird looks.  I was extremely grateful. 

Just wanted to say thanks to the strangers who swapped, thanks to the pilot, and thanks to the flight attendants. You all made one of our worst vacation experiences bearable and it just felt good to know there are strangers that still have your back.

1g3mssk,2024-10-15 02:22:42,"Delta bumped me from my flight said it was a ""scheduling issue"" but my wife remained on the flights.","Hi all, wondering who I can contact to figure out why this was done after a frustrating exchange with Delta's booking dept.

So to start off: My wife and I are taking our honeymoon in November. Flying from RSW to FCO (Rome) and then taking a transatlantic cruise back home. I booked our Delta tickets the first week of August. She has never flown in a plane before, so I made sure we were on a flight where we would be seated next to each other and not fly in 3-seat row wide aircraft.

In September, the flight times were changed and my layover in JFK was reduced, which was nice. I was e-mailed about this change and all was good. I was NOT notified of this next change..

Yesterday I went into the Delta app to enter in our passport information and was startled to see that I had been bumped of our flights. Instead of RSW-JFK-FCO, I was now on a RSW-ATL-FCO itinerary. They stated it was due to s scheduling issue, which was clearly a lie as my wife's itinerary remainded the same, but Delta then gave my seat to someone else on the JFK-FCO flight. I called the booking dept to get find out what was going on and to get this resolved. They were wholly unhelpful and only offered to downgrade us to get me onto the original itinerary. So, I checked the seating charts and was able to see that my new itinerary, on a (imo crappier plane) had an open seat next to me, so we eventually got that changed.

This took me nearly two hours on the phone to get done and has ruined our already booked car service to get us to the airport, leaving us with needing to find a new one as they are not available with a driver for the new time (out the deposit for that too). They offered absolutely nothing for the inconvenience and offered no explanation other than ""scheduling issue"" that bumped me off my flight and gave my seat to another passenger.

Is there anything I can do at this point? This experience has really put me off Delta, and they are who I have exclusively flown with more many years now.

  
EDIT: Thanks everyone for their input and telling me ""how it is"" with Delta/other airlines in general. I understand the things many have outlined and how I essentially agree to having this happen since I didn't book together.

For context on anyone reading this:

I am about to go into bankruptcy and this honeymoon trip is being paid for completely with cc reward points and miles. We are flying one-way from RSW-FCO and once in Italy, we are taking a transatlantic cruise back to Florida, so there is no return flight. My wife is a first-time flyer, as in she has never flown on a plane before, so she certainly does not have a Delta account (she does now) and certainly has no miles.

I used my SkyMiles to pay for my ticket:

59,500 for Delta+, I had 81K miles, so not enough for two tickets.

It would not let me book my miles flight and a standard fare on the same booking.

I used Delta gift cards that were from redeeming AMEX rewards to pay for her ticket:

$758 for Delta+.

I spent the whole day at the JFK lounge, flew on a 767-400 middle row seat, and then landed to spent 2 more hours in the LAX D1 Lounge. 

The LAX Lounge had only been open one week so they were super curious how I compared JFK to LAX. I thought LAX food was better, but JFK was much bigger and offered more services.

Notable takeaways
- no time limit on D1 Lounges 
- JFK is super empty before 12pm but gets almost as crowded as Sky Club in afternoon
- JFK had a shoe shine and shirt steaming service while you shower!
- food at both are amazing ($$$-$$$$ level)
- my favorite in LAX was the Ora King Salmon and Hamachi Crudo, favorite in JFK was the Tuna Crudo, Diver Scallops, and Chocolate Souffle
- you can mix-and-match your 3-course meal at JFK's Brasserie restaurant (I had 2x appetizers, 4x mains, 1x dessert over two meals) 
- Brasserie meal can takes 1.5 hrs 
- the attendants are super friendly and attentive
- both D1 shower suites were stocked with same freebies - ask for the free face wash!
- there are little drink stations everywhere in the lounge 
- JFK has two sets of noise isolation pads at either end for work calls

Overall, highly recommend the D1 Lounges. Best domestic lounges I've tried to date!

1ej23ew,2024-08-03 20:23:07,First public comment on family seating shows that people don't understand/aren't willing to do even the bare minimum to get adjacent seating,"First public comment on the DOT family seating proposed rule (DOT-OST-2024-0091-0001) illustrates the problem.

A mom of three, she states ""Middle seats are sometimes free but it can still cost over $100 for each leg of a flight just for seats. And forget about the bulkhead to allow the kids the stretch in. Please let families sit together for free - the online booking tool already knows the traveler age before seat selection. It saves parents from begging people with noise canceling headphones to give up their seats they paid for.""

Today, now, families *can* sit together, for free, on almost every airline. All you have to do is *call*. When you buy basic economy seats you can't do it through the website, and are repeatedly told that you can't when you buy the tickets. All you have to do is read the screen - read something other than the absolute cheapest airfare possible.

If you don't call and make those arrangements and just show up to start begging for people to give up the seats they paid for you are doing it wrong.

But because so many people won't read and are addicted to lowest advertised price, completely ignoring all of the myriad of add-on fees, charges and expenses there is immense demand to establish a federal rule. Now, yes, the rule isn't necessarily a bad thing, but do we really have to establish federal rules because people refuse to read?

Maybe the website/app needs to add a feature that turns the screen red when you book your tickets with minor kids that says ""STOP! You have purchased tickets but have failed to ensure that your children have adjacent seats! You must call or chat RIGHT NOW to make these arrangements before your purchase is complete!"" Not unreasonable to expect that when you say you have a 6 year old you want them next to you, so lead them to the oasis of adjacent seating and hope they drink.",TheQuarantinian,619,1216,delta

I love dogs, I know not everyone does, but this was the calmest, most friendly without being jumpy dog I've ever met, an absolute sweetheart. The man begins to apologize and says ""I'm so sorry he's going under the seat in front of me"" (he fit, but it didn't look comfortable). 

No one sits in the middle seat so I tell the guy ""please, let him sit in the middle."" He seemed very grateful, and the dog did too. It was a pretty rocky climb out and I turn to the guy and in all seriousness ask ""Hey can I pet your dog?"" He was more than happy.

That was when I gave in. I was holding up boarding, not that I cared. I won‚Äôt be giving up my seat in the future, your comments are incredible and I thank you for the backed support, many people in the plane were shocked that I wouldn‚Äôt do it. 

I flew from LGA-DEN yesterday. I booked a main ticket with a window seat. Delta upgraded me to COMF+ to a window seat (I fly 1-2 times a month and am a RESERVE cardholder). As we all know, you can put your seat preference in your upgrade request and I never sit anywhere other than a window seat. I get claustrophobic in the middle and the aisle makes me annoyed with people getting up and down and walking past me. 

As I was arriving to my seat, a dad and his 2 kids were seated in my entire row. When I mentioned his kid was in my seat, he proceeded to tell me Delta ‚Äúdid him dirty‚Äù and split up him and his kids, with each kid having a middle seat somewhere else in COMF+. He proceeded to mention that he booked last minute and couldn‚Äôt get seats together. 

This was only the start to many seat changes. He told me the seat he could give me was the middle seat behind my row, I did tell him no. For a 4.5 hour flight, I would not be giving up my window seat to his kid. A woman in the aisle one row back and over offered to give me her aisle seat to sit in the middle seat next to her husband. I was annoyed but figured it was for a dad on Father‚Äôs Day and proceeded to accept the aisle seat. Then the guy boarded for his aisle seat that the other kid was occupying. This kid was already asleep and the dad pleaded with the other guy as well. This guy had paid for a COMF+ seat in the aisle because he had long legs and needed to get up every so often. He was frustrated but ultimately obliged as to not wake the kid. He sat in the middle seat next to me and you could tell he was visibly uncomfortable. His wife was in the aisle seat in front of me and they got up and switched every so often so he could extend his legs. 

It‚Äôs completely ridiculous to expect people to give up their aisle and window seats because people can‚Äôt plan accordingly. The FAs ultimately thanked us for switching seats but I was up every 45 min on this longer flight due to no longer having a window. Some of us plan accordingly and it sucks when others don‚Äôt.

1ebil5s,2024-07-25 09:31:18,Stranded for 5 days with a 2 and 4 year old - This was tough.,"TLDR: I have a 2 and 4 year old. I spent 5 days trying to get on a flight home. Countless hours were spent in lines, on the phone, and on the app trying to get my family home. We had cancelation after cancelation. What upsets me the most is while our flights were being cancelled, Delta continued to sell tickets to flights that could get us home. When you have hundreds of thousands of people and families stranded, why is the CEO, Ed Bastian, still allowing ticket sales instead of prioritizing getting the people whose flights were cancelled home?! 

Let me start by saying all my experiences with Delta employees were great. I thank them for their help and relentless perseverance during this time. My issue is how the CEO and others at the top handled this situation. 

My wife, 2 young children, and I started our trip on the west coast at 3 am Saturday morning. We were scheduled for a flight with a connecting flight to our home city. Our original flight was delayed. When we checked our bags our connecting flight was changed, so instead of getting home at 4 pm, we were set to get home at 1 am. Not ideal, it was going to be a long day, but understandable. 

Our first flight flew after a few hours of delays. We then waited a very long time while our connecting flight was repeatedly delayed several hours, then eventually cancelled. We got a hotel around midnight. My family was exhausted. 

The next day we went to the airport and waited in line for 3 hours and got scheduled for a flight that night at 11 pm. Not ideal, but ok. We were at the airport for about 14 hours this day. During this time, our flight got delayed to leave 4 am. I waited in line a few hours, got our flight changed to a city 2 hours away from home which would leave sooner. That flight got delayed several times. We waited until 1 am until that flight was cancelled. 

When we left the airport to get a hotel, I looked at the line for help with a Delta agent. There was at least 300 people in that line. I think 600 is a more accurate estimate. There was 1 Delta employee servicing all of them. The employee took about 4 minutes per person (understandable). But there was no way the employer was going to get to everyone. I felt so sad for all those people and for that employee. Many young children were in line. It broke my heart. 

I took my family to a hotel instead of waiting for the 4 am flight to my home city. My kids were exhausted. That was the right call as the next day I saw that flight got cancelled as well. 

Getting a hotel on the second night was tough. My wonderful wife called several hotels. All were full. Eventually, we found one for $330 for the night. This hotel usually costs $90 but they were raising the prices because of the situation. This was by far the grossest hotel I've stayed in my entire life. I was thankful my family had beds. 

That was 2 nights in a row of keeping my children up late trying to get them home. I had messed up. I refused to do it again. On the next day, Tuesday, I played with the kids while my wife went to the airport to get us a flight. We had already tried the app countless times and been on the phone almost constantly. Neither of those worked. The only thing that worked was getting someone in person. I told my wife to refuse any night flight. She went and the representative told us the soonest we could get home was Tuesday night with a flight that left at 11 pm. My wife said no and took a Wednesday day flight instead. We had been studying the flights and noticed the night flights usually get cancelled. We were right, Tuesday's flight got cancelled. The Wednesday flight got delayed, but it had liftoff. I am writing this on the airplane now. If we had taken the Tuesday night flight we were offered, we would have been up very late again and without a flight today, again. 

Every night my children begged me to go home. When I'd tell them we had a flight, they said it would probably get cancelled again. They had figured it out. 

Anyways, I left a lot out about the many lines, phone calls, and the app that kept telling us we couldn't make any changes. It was tough and I'm very upset at the CEO, Ed Bastian. He should have been at a service desk servicing those 600 people, many with children, stuck in the airport at 1 am. He should have stopped ticket sales and got the people in the airports home. It hurt going to agents and asking to get a flight home, being told a certain flight is the soonest we can make it home, but going online and seeing if I had 2 grand I could buy 4 tickets for my family to go home on a sooner flight. The CEO's actions have shown he doesn't care about doing what is right. He just wants to make money. 

I hope I get refunded for the hotels because they cost more than I currently have in my bank account. That's also why I didn't buy a flight with a different airline. Those would have been very expensive for my family and not something we could easily afford to do unless we were positive it would be refunded. 

CEO of Delta Ed Bastian - I forgive you if you take 90% or more of your 34 million dollar salary for this year and issue it to all of your employees. You screwd up, big time, and they covered for you. Thanks.",Explicit65,143,1555,delta

1g7kq8a,2024-10-20 06:45:56,Thinking about Dedicating One Year of My Life Towards Lifetime Diamond Medallion,"Beginning of this year, Delta revamped its Million Miler program. For 3 MM, you get Diamond for life. Achieving this would make it so much easier than painfully tracking and worrying about MQDs every year. I started drafting an idea in my head and hope to get feasibility checks from y'all.

# The Plan

Longest nonstop route Delta currently operates is daily ATL-JNB, which gives 8,439 miles towards MM. The following scheduled departure and arrival are all in local times.

DL200: Departs ATL at 10:00PM and arrives JNB at 7:40PM (15 hours and 40 min)

DL201: Departs JNB at 9:55PM and arrives ATL at 8:15AM (16 hours and 20 min)

This short layover would be perfect for me to check right back in and board the return flight to ATL. Total round trip including the layover would take roughly 34 hours, which I plan to do in a 48-hour (2-day) window, with the remaining 14 hours spent at various lounges at ATL.

If I do this for a year, I would be able to fly ATL-JNB round-trip 182 times, which would accumulate me 8,439\*2\*182 = 3,071,796 miles towards MM! And I'd be Diamond for life after this!

# What about work?

Assuming high-speed Wi-Fi is consistent on this flight, I would still be able to do my work onboard, at airports and in lounges, all sticking to US EST. Therefore, I would expect some minor interruptions from time to time but I would not need quit my job.

# Cost-Savings Analysis

This part is not fully constructed yet. I imagine the cost would greatly outweigh my savings for the first year, but I'm not sure what value to put on a lifetime Diamond Medallion, so in the long run this might still be worthwhile.

Cost:

Flights, that's all. Typical roundtrip costs $3k on average (MC), for 182 trips, it would cost me $546k.

Savings:

I currently live in NYC and would consider claiming residency in a state without state income tax before doing this. I still need to look into how air travel time counts towards residency for state income tax purposes. Ideally, I would be saving on NYC rent, food, and state &amp; city taxes. My savings won't outweigh the cost unfortunately but are also not negligible.

So, I was visiting my hometown this weekend. I stopped by my father's apartment in a big city. My father is always finding or being given new-ish electronics that the ""rich"" cannot or do not want to fix (this is relevant, I promise). So, he recently found a perfectly good dyson vacuum that was tossed away- just needed a battery replacement. Knowing how I always wanted one, he offered it to me to take home in my checked bag. 

Fast forward to today, I was told at the counter that the battery portion needed to go in my carry-on (it's really thin and comes apart into 3 parts). I complied - took it out and put it a bag in the stroller. I get to the entrance of the plane, scrambling to get my shit together with 2 little ones by myself, a line of people waiting for me to be done, I accidentally forget to take it out of the stroller bag and check it in with the stroller and baby car seat. It had only occurred to me that I forgot to put in in my personal bag- as originally intended- as the plane was already driving to take off. I immediately started to panic (silently) and notified a FA once I did a quick Google search to confirm it was a lithium ion battery. The FA was really nice and said not to worry that they'll inform the front but that it's too late to actually do anything. 

As the FA was serving snacks, I politely declined because I was too anxious to eat. The FA then said that the lead (?) would like to speak with me when we arrive.

Please someone, how much trouble am I really in? I swear I would never try to jeopardize anyone's life. I have untreated ADHD (currently breastfeeding, can't take medication for it) on top of being a mom to young children, my memory is shot!

I'm so scared and nauseous right now. Am I going to be banned from flying? Am I going to be fined? The guilt alone is worse.

UPDATE:
 
I am not dead or in jail. It's safe to say I overreacted a little... much. They didn't even seem to care. The lead FA thought I had additional questions, which is why I was told I was to speak with them after. Damn though, the og FA could have saved me from all that stress had he just said I was not in trouble and not give me the ""they will need to speak with you later"" in such an ominous tone.

I guess I was freaking out because, well, you know, it's a fucking airplane. I don't know how they operate. I just follow the rules.

Anyways, sorry the title was misleading (I got caught up in the moment of what I thought was the start of my crime career). Sorry if this was not the update you wanted. It sure is the outcome I wanted. ",donnadimistero,945,9564,delta

I travel 2x/month or more US-EU for work. My work doesn't pay for J, only R, so upgrades are primary. Also, wife travels with me a few times per year, and only wants to use points &amp; upgrade instruments. We generally won't fly overnight unless we're in J.

I don't fly DL much anymore, as I switched to UA in 2018 and have had Global Services (their version of 360) pretty much ever since. GS combined with PlusPoints (UA's version of RUC/GUC) is one of the last great deals in Big 3 loyalty: highest upgraded priority; can upgrade others without flying; can upgrade award tickets. I've therefore only flown once in

But I may not make it to GS next year, so I need to figure out if I should convert enough points for DM + GUCs, or just go for 500k SkyMiles. I'm at $4500 MQD for the year, so the 25% MQD / 75% SkyMiles option would result in $31k MQD for the year and 400k miles. That seems like the sweet spot for me, right?

ETA: I am assuming two things:

1. The $27k MQD conversion would be added to my earned 2024 MQD $4500 to get me well past the $28k threshold for DM in 2025
2. Extending status would *b*e a waste, since I haven't earned even SM, but have ""lifetime"" PM thanks to 2MM",thatben,7,4,delta

Submitted to Delta this morning: 

&gt; I was recently on a flight from MSP to HND and, as one often is on a long haul flight, quite thirsty. But even by several hours after the first meal I had only received two small cups of soda. I asked a flight attendant who told me that that Delta no longer provides bottles of water ""to save costs"". I was then given a half cup of water - not even a full one. I apologize for perhaps the unreasonable expectation, but it seems ludicrous to me that Delta has removed the provision of bottles of water during long haul overseas flights - especially ones of 6,000 miles. Between this and myriad other recent decisions it seems to me that Delta, and Ed Bastian, are desperate to convince even Million Milers like me to take my business elsewhere. The leadership decisions being made make zero sense in context of longevity, willfully trading Delta's pre-covid reputation for short-term gains that will be fine for Ed's parachute but a nightmare for his successors and anyone else who chooses to hold Delta stock for a longer term.

1g3oodp,2024-10-15 03:39:25,Layover time in ATL question,"A schedule change has boosted my anxiety. We are traveling from Portland PDX to Quito, Ecuador through Atlanta. At time of booking, we had a 2.5 hour layover in Atlanta. A schedule change has dropped that down to 1 hour. I've never been to the Atlanta airport but I understand that it's huge. I'm the kind of person that is always early, giving myself plenty of time to navigate and this change is stressing me out. This is exacerbated by the fact that I was recently in Seattle and the plane traffic was so backed up that we were in the airplane for 30 minutes after we landed because there were no available gates. That meant running to get on my next flight. 

I don't fly Delta often, but generally airlines give you the opportunity to change flights if they've made a schedule change. When I called Delta to do so, they said that I would have to change both of my flights, that it was not possible to change just one. Because there is only one flight per day, this wouldn't help me at all. Even if I changed days, the times are the same. They said they wouldn't change it unless the layover dropped below 45 minutes.  

So, my question is, if I book a separate flight the day before into ATL, would I be able to ""start"" my original ticket in ATL? Or would they consider me a no-show or breaking rules to do this? I hope that makes sense.  I'm going to be devastated if I don't make the flight to Quito. I would lose an entire day of my trip.

Am I unnecessarily stressing about this? (I do have an anxiety disorder, so it can sometimes be difficult for me to know if I'm reasonably stressed or if it's my overthinking.) I would especially appreciate feedback from anyone familiar with ATL airport.",SpiralMetal,7,1,delta

TIL that these eCredits are ""partially transferable"", meaning, that someone else can use them, but only if the traveler whose account they are in is traveling on the itinerary in question.

So, it's pointless to use it for travel, as the $100 isn't enough to buy a whole plane ticket, and I'm otherwise booking on miles.  (BTW, yes, I tried to use it on a ""miles plus cash"" itinerary but even that didn't work).

So, my question is, for your consideration: What can my friend buy from Delta for $100 or less with this credit?  In the old days, the answer was obvious: Club one-time passes, but Delta doesn't sell those anymore AFAIK.

1655bef,2023-08-30 12:59:10,Lady insisted I switch window seat for her middle seat instead of her husbands window seat. Delta Flight attendant backed her up.,"I know this sub gets saturated with seat switching stories. But I think I just experienced the worst one I‚Äôve ever heard of.

I booked a window seat months ahead of time for a flight for work, as I get severe nausea if I can‚Äôt look out the window on a flight.  I‚Äôm sitting next to two kids, who appear to be around 12-14 years old.  Their mother appears and directs me to move to her seat so she can sit next to her kids.  (She didn‚Äôt ask me to switch, she TOLD me I would be moving.). I look at where her seat is and it‚Äôs a middle seat in the second to last row.  

Her husband is sitting in the window seat in that same row.  I tell her that I make a point of booking a window seat over the wing to help with my nausea but I understand wanting to sit next to your kids so I can switch seats with her husband for his window seat, even though there‚Äôs more movement in the back of the plane.  She responds - I shit you not - ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring my husband into this, this about needing to sit next to my kids.‚Äù

We went back and forth a bit where I kept pointing out that her own husband wasn‚Äôt willing to take a middle seat to allow her to sit next to her kids.  Again and again, she kept saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring my husband into this.‚Äù It went nowhere so I just told her that I was sorry (I wasn‚Äôt) but that I wasn‚Äôt moving. She responded by calling me a child.  

The thing that irritated me the most is that she called the flight attendant who then took her side, even after I offered one final time to change window seats with the husband and the lady refusing that offer.  The flight attendant also directed (again, not asked, but told me) to move and exchange seats with this woman.  I again said no, put my headphones in, and turned the music up.  After a bit the lady called me a selfish asshole and took her seat.  The flight attendant also went back to her other duties.

It‚Äôs been 8 hours since we landed and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the audacity it takes to insist a total stranger switch to a middle seat to allow a family to fly together, when her own husband refused to take that same downgrade.  I hope this doesn‚Äôt affect me on future Delta flights.

Edit:  Its been pointed out to me I should make a clarification.  The FA wasn‚Äôt insistent that I move seats, though she did say ‚Äúsir, just move seats with her‚Äù or something akin to that more than once.  The FA also did imply I was being unreasonable, though she didn‚Äôt outright say it. But from the tone of her voice it was just clear she was over the whole situation and trying to find a resolution.  The FA probably did mean it as a firmly-worded request rather than a clear directive under FAA regulations.

1fhsmo3,2024-09-16 09:19:24,"CRJ-900 first class Karen is The Most Important Person On The Plane who ""paid hundreds of dollars more than anybody else""","I flew DTW-YYZ today on a non-atmosphere 900. I was about the 8th out of 12 first class passengers to board, so I had to put my rollaboard in about row 6. This wasn't a big deal because I fly 900s a lot and was expecting this since I was the 8th person on board.

(I saw another first class passenger put both her rollaboard and backpack in overhead, but I didn't say anything and didn't care because my rollaboard wasn't too far away in row 6. But shhh...don't tell r/delta I let this slide :-) )

I had an aisle seat and the next few zones were boarding like normal. The flight attendant took first class drink orders like normal. It was mid-80s and sunny in DTW in mid-September. Life was great. I was living the dream.

Then suddenly, *The Most Important Person On The Plane* came aboard. She was about the 50th person to board and probably boarded with zone 6. The first indication she was *The Most Important Person On The Plane* was when she wildly started turning her torso left and right in the first class aisle before reaching her 3A seat as she looked at the full overhead bins. As *The Most Important Person On The Plane*, she knew she was entitled to carelessly knock people in the head with her overstuffed backpack (including me in 2C). But she was just getting started.

*The Most Important Person On The Plane* started loudly asking ""WHOSE BAGS ARE THESE? THESE OVERHEAD SPOTS ARE FOR FIRST CLASS! PEOPLE IN THE BACK: GET YOUR BAGS OUT OF THESE SPOTS!!!""

Math was apparently not her strongest subject in school because there are 12 first class seats on a 900 (1-2 configuration with 4 rows) but there is only overhead space for 6-8 rollaboards in first class. Only the starboard side overhead bins can accommodate rollaboards. The port side overhead bins are precisely engineered to only accommodate individual, unwrapped Cheerios. First class late-comers have to go back a few rows like I had to.

In between getting slugged in the face by her backpack Mike Tyson, I said ""There is some space a few rows back. I had to do the same.""

*The Most Important Person On The Plane* was not having any of my advice. She yelled ""I PAID HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE TO HAVE OVERHEAD SPACE AT MY SEAT!""

*The Most Important Person On The Plane* turned some of the first class rollaboards 90 degrees sideways like we put them in overhead on non-regionals. But on non-atmosphere 900s, obviously this doesn't allow the bin to close. Another person in first class told *The Most Important Person On The Plane* ""that's not going to work,"" but *The Most Important Person On The Plane* just huffed back at her, left the bag sideways, and left the bin door open.

*The Most Important Person On The Plane* then sat down in her seat and left her rollaboard in the aisle. As *The Most Important Person On The Plane*, she was entitled to do this.

She then shouted ""FLIGHT ATTENDANT, I NEED HELP. HELP!!!! HELP!!!!""

Others were still trying to board behind *The Most Important Person On The Plane*, so her bag in the aisle was holding up everybody, including the flight attendant who was trying to reach her to calm her down.

Eventually, the flight attendant squeezed by the 3-4 other people in the aisle and told *The Most Important Person On The Plane* ""there is some space a few rows back.""

*The Most Important Person On The Plane* was not having any of that. Again, she screamed ""I PAID HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE TO HAVE OVERHEAD AT MY SEAT!!!""

The flight attendant relented and said ""I'll stow your rollaboard in the closet. You can pick it up on your way out after we land.""

Finally, *The Most Important Person On The Plane* seemed appeased. For the entire flight, she was quiet. I assume she was either passed out drunk, extremely hungover from binging on an overseas flight and trying to sleep it off, or flat-lining from missing a dose of medication. Or so I thought...

We landed at YYZ and got to the gate 20 minutes early. Score. The ""unbuckle seat belt"" ding went off.

I waited 2 seconds and saw nobody else stood up behind me. Knowing my bag was a few rows behind me, I sprung up, moved like the wind from 2C to 6C to grab my rollaboard, and started moving back to 2C in front of *The Most Important Person On The Plane*. This took all of 5 seconds. Thank you, inner Bruce Lee.

(Selfishly, I wanted to make sure I beat everybody else on my plane to immigration. This saves a few minutes in line.)

*The Most Important Person On The Plane* stuck her arm out and made contact with my rollaboard. Out of politeness, I stopped.

*The Most Important Person On The Plane* yelled ""WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? IN A HURRY TO GET OFF THE PLANE BEFORE US FIRST CLASS PASSENGERS?""

Me: ""I'm just going back to my seat in row 2 so I can grab my water bottle and backpack. Like 10 other people, I have been in first class with you for this flight.""

*The Most Important Person On The Plane*: ""OH, FINE."" She lowered her arm and let me move another 18 inches forward so I could get back to my seat.

A family made my poor mother so uncomfortable. My mother flew delta the other day and had purchased the comfort plus middle seat in the row behind first class. There weren‚Äôt any window/aisle seats available so she chose the option with the most room. The flight was over booked and a couple had booked the window and aisle seat next to my mother. While the husband went to the bathroom during boarding, the wife asked my mom if she could switch seats with her teenage son who was sitting in the middle seat of like row 24. My mom obviously said no because she paid for the seat. So the wife asked my mom if she could switch seats to sit next to her husband. Clearly her whole seating arrangement didn‚Äôt go as planned. The husband came back and made a scene about my mom not switching with his son and now her sitting in the window seat. My mom continued to ignore them, while he continued to complain and tried to intimidate her to move. My mom was over the husband bitching so she offered to move back to her original middle seat and the wife quickly declined. Meanwhile all of this could‚Äôve been avoided if the family had purchased the middle seat my mom was sitting in. People need to learn how to behave idk",ComfortableWheel736,259,2269,delta

Booked thru Delta a flight from Seattle to London/Heathrow.  Excited! 

  
Scored Economy Delight.  Excited!  (simple things excite me!)

  
HOWEVER...

  
Would like to throw my hat in the ring to bid for an economy plus upgrade.  My flight isn't until the end of November and looking at the seat maps, the flight doesn't look especially full at the moment.  But, when I click ""Bid for Upgrade"" on the flight page on the Virgin website, it takes me to another page (upgrade.plusgrade.com/offer...etc) and says, ""We're sorry, it looks like there are no upgrades available t bid for on this flight""

  
Is that because there are truly no upgrades?  Or is it because I'm trying too early?

Wife and I were in 1st, I had used a RUC.  Our grown daughter was so far in the back, I think she landed 5 minutes after we did.    


Anyways, wife and I deplaned and there was a very nice gentleman with a IPAD with our names on it. Wife looks at me and says ""what did we do?"", I was like ""I have no idea"", but saw the Porsche at the bottom of the stairs.  We waited for my daughter to deplane, in the meantime he took our bags and loaded them.  


Got in the car, had a very nice talk about Delta, the airport and the car.  We were in the gas powered one, they have an EV, but the driver said he preferred the gas one.  The EV takes 'forever' to charge in his words.  Took us right to the skyclub, he took our bags up and we entered.  I'm still wondering what triggered it, but we'll talk about it for years to come.  It was such an unexpected moment, but was so fun.

1g3krc4,2024-10-15 01:00:25,To the mystery farter in D1,"Just discovered this subreddit and thought I'd share. JFK&gt;LAX a few days ago, a pretty regular route I'd been flying for work (diamond medallion, of course). I was in D1, and we were just chilling on the tarmac, waiting to take off. My seatmates were super chatty, and the conversation was flowing‚Äîswapping favorite Sky Lounge meals, close calls with tight connections, and even showing off our trading cards. Just a bunch of high-flyers who truly understood the grind and the glory of earning those diamond wings.

And then it happened. Mid-conversation, just as one of the guys was regaling us with his favorite Sky Club story, an unmistakable scent filled the cabin. We all paused, noses wrinkling in unison, looking around for the culprit. You could practically see the thought bubbles over each of our heads: Who did it?

The air grew tense as we all exchanged glances. No one was owning up, of course, so the blame game was on. Finally, I leaned back with a smirk and, channeling my inner comedian, dropped the line of the flight:

‚ÄúHe who smelta, Delta.‚Äù

We all lost it, laughing louder than we probably should‚Äôve in a confined cabin space. I even heard the FA try to hold back a chuckle. The rest of the flight went on like a family reunion, and by the time we landed, I knew I‚Äôd remember that punchline and that crew of strangers forever.

1g9brtb,2024-10-22 14:33:53,Trip report: love a daytime TATL,"Flew JFK-CDG yesterday, on the soon-to-be-discontinued dayside flight, the first daytime flight to Europe I've taken since 1997.

It was hard getting up at 4am after going to a show the previous night, and we took a car to Jamaica AirTrain after seeing the warning here about traffic issues at T4. Chaos at the bag drop line (including people taking long selfie videos at the kiosks and not, y'know, using them) with no roaming agents like I usually see at LGA and elsewhere. Digital ID bag dropoff not open, but used the comparatively-untrafficked self-service bag dropoff line.

Enjoyed the Chase Sapphire/Etihad lounge before boarding.

I think this was one of the emptiest flights I've been on - our C+ upgrade (from silver) cleared exactly 24 hours out, and I can see why, as there were at least six completely empty C+ rows. Maybe forty people or so in Main. Reasonably comfortable 764, decent food, friendly crew. Got trading cards for Team USA/A350, 763, and 764.

But it is so great to land at 9:30pm, breeze through immigration (zero line), get to your accommodation, go to bed, and get up early the next morning not feeling absolutely wrecked. CDG even felt far less surreal/Ballardian on arrival than usual, because I wasn't strung out from bad sleep!

1fzwief,2024-10-10 01:07:31,I was punched in the face by another passenger - Delta is saying there‚Äôs nothing they can do ,"I was flying from Detroit to Los Angeles on flight DL0908 and about an hour into the flight, I was punched in the eye by another passenger. At first, I didn‚Äôt even realize what was going on (I was watching a movie with noise canceling headphones), but the flight attendant saw it happen and asked the guy, ‚ÄúDid you just punch her?‚Äù She then confirmed with me that I had just been hit. Apparently, this guy had been vaping, touching other passengers inappropriately, was extremely inebriated, and overall causing a major disturbance all over the plane. He was being escorted to the back of the plane to be detained when this happened. Another passenger had to sit in the last row with him so he didn‚Äôt harm anyone else.

The whole situation was chaotic, and I ended up with eye soreness and overall being extremely rattled and shaking for the rest of the flight. The flight attendant asked if I wanted to report it, but it seemed like they were trying to talk me out of it (probably to avoid the paperwork). I did report it and gave a statement to the police when we landed.

To make things worse, when I deplaned, the Delta agent I spoke to wasn‚Äôt even sympathetic. They told me they were aware this guy had caused trouble before the flight and that he probably should never have been allowed to board in the first place. Yet, somehow, Delta still let him on the plane.

Fast forward to now: I reached out to Delta about the incident, they offered me 4,000 SkyMiles (about $40) as a ‚Äúgoodwill gesture.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. No flight reimbursement, no further compensation, even though I fly Delta all the time for work.

Delta says they don‚Äôt get involved in conflicts between passengers, but here‚Äôs the thing: this guy shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed on the flight at all. If they had acted sooner, I wouldn‚Äôt have been assaulted.

I love flying Delta, but this whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I feel like I should be getting more than just a few thousand miles for getting punched mid-flight.



TL;DR: Disruptive passenger punched me in the eye while being escorted by flight attendants for detainment on a flight. Delta gave me 4,000 SkyMiles, but no real compensation despite knowing this guy was trouble before boarding. Looking for advice on how to handle this.

The plane has since departed LAX for Minneapolis this morning (10/08/24) and is due to land this afternoon at 2.30 CT. On the very small off chance that somebody finds the ring, could you please DM me? It would mean the world to us to be reunited with the ring.

If you purchased Wi-Fi on a Delta flight and were not satisfied with your experience, you may request a full refund

  
however chat says they can't refund.

The feedback/complaint people they refer me to offered some miles but said they also cannot refund.

Is Delta unaware that charging for a service and then not providing it is illegal?

Is anyone aware of another contact at delta to dispute this further? I'd rather have delta do their legal obligation than waste even more time going to court or something over $25.

1g6y8ah,2024-10-19 09:39:54,Questions for the Crews! ,"For the pilots and attendants: 

I'm in the air and have a lot of questions in my brain. 

First, If you're flying and have to spend the night in a city that is not your home, how does your meal situation work? I was looking it up and some things speak only to in air time and having catered meals, some speak to hotels having to have 24 hour food offerings, and some people say they bring their own home cooked meals? But what if you are just spending the night somewhere else before heading back? Can you get fast food or Uber Eats or something? Or are you doomed to airport food and whatever the front desk of the hotel has to microwave? 

Do planes have back up cameras? I asked my pilot if he had a rearview mirror and made him laugh but I forgot to ask this question. What about windshield wipers? Do those exist on planes? 

If you catch a person hosting a Zoom meeting or Facetiming during a flight, what becomes of them? 

If I'm upgraded to a bulkhead seat unexpectedly and didn't get to plan not to have bags, what's the most respectful way to address this problem? I fly in a lot of tiny planes that would never fit my carry on or personal item and keep running into this problem and want to be a good guest. 

Do you have a favorite US airport or international airport? Why is that your favorite? 

Do you collect anything along your journeys to denote each city you go to? I've recently began collecting postcards in each airport so I've been curious if the crews also do.

Last, what is the weirdest pet someone has brought in your plane? Was it well behaved?

1b3atr3,2024-03-01 04:45:18,Delta threw me and my cat off our flight,"Story-time! This happened during Christmas (December 23rd) but was only recently ""resolved"" and I'm still fuming about it.

First of all I never thought I'd ever need to fly with my cat but due to unforeseen circumstances I knew he'd need to come with me for the holidays. I was extremely self-conscious of traveling with him and being a burden on my fellow passengers, so I tried to do my due diligence to make sure I understood Delta's rules, TSA/FAA policy, and general best practices to make it as stress-free for him and others.

My flight was booked in mid-October. Days after, via the Delta app, I connected with a representative to have him added to my trip. They told me there was space on the flight and asked for some info about him including his carrier and size. The carrier in question was the medium Sherpa Delta Airlines Travel Pet Carrier, which claims to be ‚Äúapproved and guaranteed onboard‚Äù and was purchased specifically for this trip. The representative confirmed that both carrier and my cat were well within the regulations and that he was cleared to fly so long as I paid the $95 pet fee upon arrival at the airport. I called Delta‚Äôs support line a few days later to reconfirm that he was listed on my ticket.

To further prevent any duress, I took him to the vet to make sure his vaccines were up to date and receive Gabapentin to sedate him for the journey. The medication I got was to be administered orally and required refrigeration. It was supposed to last 12 hours. I also purchased and packed a portable litter box, two Ziplock bags of litter, a travel water bottle, food and treats, pee pads, a pillowcase to line his carrier (so it smelled like home) and some toys. I was nervous, but felt ready.

Two hours before leaving for the airport I administered the sedative. By the time I was in my Lyft, he was pretty much out. I arrived at LAX and promptly went to check-in with an actual representative. She confirmed there was room for him on the flight and I was charged the $95 pet fee. I checked my one bag and proceeded through TSA where he and the carrier were hand checked and cleared. From there I went to my gate and waited about an hour to board. This is where the good times ended.

I was in Zone 3, which means we boarded close to last. As I was in line, maybe 4-5 people from the agent and scanner, my name was called out over the intercom and I was instructed to go to the front desk. The agent proceeded to tell me that Delta has a 5 or 6 pet limit per flight for coach and that my cat and I meant they were 1 over so we were no longer permitted to fly. I was honestly shocked. I told the agent I had paid the fee and even confirmed months ahead that he could come with me to which the agent said he‚Äôd check with the flight crew to see if they could make an exception. When he got back, he said they would not be making an exception because my cat was deemed ‚Äúa safety hazard.‚Äù Then I got to watch as my seat was given to someone on standby and the plane was pushed back from the gate. Oh and my checked bag with all my clothes was still onboard.

The supervisor was extremely kind and patient with me given the situation. He rebooked me on a later flight and gave me a voucher for lunch. He also told me he would put a note on my updated ticket to allow me to board early in case there were other pets ahead of me. I asked if there was any place I could go to wait with my cat and was pointed in the direction of the pet relief room. Never in my life have I been in a more disgusting space. After waiting in line to use it, we were greeted with a stinky room covered in puddles of dog piss. My cat wouldn‚Äôt even get out of the carrier. I ended up resorting to periodically taking him to the nursing room to use the litter box, but because it was sandwiched between the bathrooms, the constant sound of footsteps and toilets meant he hid in his carrier for the most part.

When they announced early boarding on the new flight, I immediately got up. This time the gate agent wasn‚Äôt as nice. He said I was boarding out of order and when I told him what the previous agent had said I was met with, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt get to decide that, the flight crew does.‚Äù I protested and he eventually relented and let me board. By the time we were in the air, my cat had been kenneled for nearly 12+ hours. About halfway through the trip, the Gabapentin wore off and he became irate, meowing and scratching at his carrier, eventually completely soiling himself, the pee pad, and the pillowcase. I ended up making around 5-7 trips with him to the airplane bathroom in an attempt to mitigate the mess and to prevent the other passengers from having to deal with the noise.

After all was said and done, it was an excruciatingly long and horrible experience. After my return flight, which luckily went off without a hitch, my dad and I reached out to Delta about the incident. They apologized, but said the best thing they could do was offer me a $200 gift certificate, which after paying $190 to travel with my cat means I got a $10 apology (and that ignores all the money I spent on vet trips and supplied in preparation). Delta made $4.6 billion in profit for 2023. At this point, I don‚Äôt think I will voluntarily fly with them ever again.
  

**TL;DR: Paid $190 to fly with cat, got thrown off the flight, received a $10 apology.**  
    

Edit 1: Bolded the TL;DR because apparently y'all are upset with having to read a text post.  
Edit 2: I'm honestly shocked at the number of people blaming me for this mess despite multiple Delta employees telling me I was cleared to fly ahead of time.  
Edit 3: I tried to preboard my second flight. That's when the gate agent said ""we don't get to decide that, the flight crew does"" per the instructions of the previous gate agent.  
Edit 4: Since some of you are mocking me for having my dad help, he's Diamond Medallion with Delta, whereas I rarely fly.  
Edit 5: The $200 I got from Delta was not cash. It was only redeemable on gift cards.  
Edit 6: A few people are shaming me for using the unoccupied nursing room. If I ever fly again I guess I'll let him pee in the terminal for everyone to watch. Is that better? He was too scared to leave his crate, so he didn't use the litterbox. I just sat there in the room and watched him do nothing.  
Edit 7: The TSA doesn't even understand its policies (much like Delta). LAX let me fly with cat litter, but in Boston it was confiscated and I was told to never try flying with it again.  
Edit 8: This my last edit for a bit. Y'all are exhausting and rude. For those asking ""what do you want?"" Ultimately, I don't think there's anything that can or will be done about it. It happened and the chapter is closed. I just wanted to share my experience with other people who may consider flying with a pet. Don't like that I flew with my cat? Go cry about about it because it's perfectly legal and allowed by the airlines.  
Edit 9: Big thank you to whoever downvoted every single comment I've ever made. This has been a fun one.

1fxu1i2,2024-10-07 07:33:40,Great Experience with Delta Vacations (First Time Using DV),"I've seen so many posts across the web warning people how bad DV is and all the issues they experienced so I wanted to share my experience.

* Tue October 1st I realized I needed to take a quick drive up from NJ to Boston for an event Friday night. I just need a hotel and decide to try DV.
* I book the Hyatt Regency Downtown Boston for 1 night with check-in on Friday and check-out on Saturday. 
* Since I don't want a rental car, I call DV and am connected with someone within 3 minutes. I ask them if they can make me a hotel-only ""package"". They happily did so over the phone with no issues.
* I arrived at the hotel on Friday around 10pm after the event in Boston finished and they checked me in. They upgraded me to a high floor (21st) and provided me free breakfast for 2 and a $10 voucher for their restaurant to use for dinner. They also offered me discounted spa, free high speed wifi, and free Boston magnet. I do not have any Hyatt status so to get all these perks was impressive. 
* The entire process from check-in to check-out was super smooth. I have high status with Marriott and often book direct with them so I wasn't sure how a no-status DV booking would go.
* Probably the biggest reason I tried DV -- the MQDs! I booked for $546 for the night. I checked out at 10am on Saturday and before 10am today (Sunday) I got $496 MQDs deposited into my account. I was so surprised the MQDs deposited in less than 24 hrs with no issues! I've had MQDs from flights take longer to deposit. 

  
This experience has made me a lot more comfortable with booking DV. I like to change my flights a lot between booking and departure date so I don't feel comfortable doing DV packages with flights involved BUT to book a package of hotel only or hotel+car seems like a no brainer for extra MQDs (if I need it). 

I hope people who are on the fence about DV consider trying it out!",shawnwahi,4,19,delta

----------
The breakdown of Delta Medallion members across different tiers is estimated as follows:

Silver: Approximately 80% of Medallion members, or about 2% of all SkyMiles accounts[2].
Gold: Around 12% of Medallion members, or about 0.3% of all accounts[2].
Platinum: Roughly 6% of Medallion members, or about 0.15% of all accounts[2].
Diamond: About 2% of Medallion members, or approximately 0.05% of all accounts[2].

1g3j4fs,2024-10-14 23:53:14,FA used my under-seat space for her belongings,"Minor complaint, just curious. I was seated in an exit row on my flight yesterday. When I got to my seat, there was a bag already under the seat in front of me. I asked the person next to me if it was hers and she said no. Turns out, it was the flight attendant‚Äôs personal belongings. 

It didn‚Äôt affect my leg room because it was an exit row, but it did force me to put my backpack in a cramped overhead 5 or so rows back and I wasn‚Äôt able to use my computer. The FA also used the pouch on the seat in front for her drink. Do FAs not have a dedicated area for this? If she asked I wouldn‚Äôt have had an issue with it, it just seemed crazy to me to have to stow my belongings as a passenger. Others on the plane had to gate-check their carry-on, partly because I had to use overhead space for my backpack, which probably wasn‚Äôt a great look. 

Not a big deal in the scheme of things, but thought the FA would have a better place to put her belongings, curious if others have seen this. She did have to use the jump-seat in our row for takeoff/landing. Also, this was definitely an odd seat configuration than other exit rows I‚Äôve seen, which probably added to it.

1fztxal,2024-10-09 23:19:59,PSA: If you're losing Platinum/Diamond status in 2025 and booking flights after February 1st...,"edit: Maybe you don't lose C+ if you downgrade to Gold or Silver Medallion? OG post below:

Make sure you turn off Comfort+ upgrades and move yourself back to Main Cabin. When you lose your status or are downgraded, you'll be kicked out of C+ and back into MC (and further down the upgrade list). However, you won't be kicked out of preferred seats (based on my mom's experience when she was Silver Medallion in 2022 and booked flights for 2023), so book those exit row seats now so you still have some of that extra legroom.

I have flights for work that first week of February, and after booking, I was automatically bumped up to C+. But even with the rollovers, I will be Gold next year, so I would likely be kicked out of C+ and placed back on the upgrade list. And by then, the exit row seats will likely be taken. There may be a small chance I would keep my C+ seat since it still would happen within the Gold upgrade window, but why take that chance? 

I guess it's time to finally burn those drink coupons.",jcrespo21,9,32,delta

I have a 1 hour and 45-minute layover at ATL on my way to Mexico City (MEX). I know this isn't ideal, but it was my only option. I‚Äôm hoping for some advice on how to make it through smoothly and avoid missing my flight as much as possible. I've heard that ATL is a huge airport but also pretty efficient‚Äîhopefully enough to get me through on time!

All my flights are booked on the same ticket, so will my luggage be checked all the way through to MEX from my starting airport? I assume it will be, but I'd like to confirm.

If anyone knows how likely it is that my arrival and departure gates will be close together, that would be great. Is there a way to check this ahead of time? Also, will I need to go through any additional security checkpoints, or is it just a straightforward transfer? If so, any tips on how to get through faster?

Lastly, as a first-time flyer, is there anything else I should know about connecting flights or airports that might not be obvious? Any specific tips for getting around ATL quickly? I‚Äôve heard they have trains between terminals‚Äîare they fast and reliable?

Thanks so much for your help!

Passengers milled around the gate, chatting, sipping coffee, and flipping through magazines, their excitement and anticipation palpable. This was the start of a journey that would prove to be delightfully unremarkable in every sense.

Boarding began, and the passengers shuffled onto the aircraft, their eyes scanning for their assigned seats. The cabin crew greeted them with warm smiles, assisting with bags and ensuring everyone settled in comfortably. The captain's voice came over the intercom, introducing himself and the crew and providing the standard flight details, including expected flying time, weather en route, and anticipated arrival time.

As the Boeing 737 taxied to the runway, passengers paid rapt attention to the safety demonstration, following along with the illustrated instructions on the screens in front of them. The aircraft's engines roared to life, and the sensation of ascent gently pressed everyone into their seats. But this was a flight marked by its absence of the unexpected, so the ascent was smooth and uneventful.

With the seatbelt sign turned off, passengers unbuckled and began to relax. The flight attendants gracefully moved up and down the aisle, offering refreshments and snacks. Smiles and gratitude flowed freely as travelers exchanged pleasantries and enjoyed their mid-air snacks. The overhead bins remained securely closed throughout the journey, a testament to the thoughtful packing of each passenger.

Looking out of the window, passengers marveled at the breathtaking view of the landscape below. The captain provided regular updates on the flight's progress, noting significant landmarks and sharing trivia about the cities and towns they passed over. Those who had chosen window seats leaned back and took pictures, capturing memories to cherish later.

The in-flight entertainment system offered an array of options, from the latest movies to classic TV shows and a variety of music genres. Passengers could be seen with headphones on, engrossed in their chosen entertainment, while others took advantage of the quiet time to read books or catch up on work. Throughout the cabin, a sense of contentment prevailed, with the hum of the engines providing a soothing backdrop.

Lunch service began, and the flight attendants diligently served passengers their choice of meal, ensuring that dietary preferences were accommodated. Conversations flowed between travelers seated next to each other, forging temporary connections that could only be formed in the confined space of an aircraft cabin. Laughter occasionally erupted, further breaking the monotony of the hours in the air.

As the flight continued its eastward journey, the afternoon sun cast long shadows inside the cabin. People took turns using the lavatories, each visit a brief interruption to the gentle flow of the flight. There was no turbulence to speak of, and even the most nervous flyers found themselves at ease in the smooth air. The flight attendants, as attentive as ever, offered extra pillows and blankets to those who sought a bit of comfort during the journey.

As the aircraft began its descent into Boston, the city's skyline came into view, framed by the orange hues of the setting sun. The captain's voice filled the cabin once again, providing details about the upcoming landing and expressing gratitude for choosing Delta Airlines. Passengers peered out of the windows, their excitement building as they caught glimpses of the city's landmarks.

With a gentle touchdown on the runway, the aircraft completed its journey. The cabin erupted in polite applause, a spontaneous gesture of appreciation for the seamless flight experience they had just enjoyed. The seatbelt sign blinked off, and passengers began to gather their belongings, forming orderly lines to disembark.

The flight attendants stood by the exit doors, bidding farewell to each passenger with genuine smiles and well wishes. The sense of camaraderie that had developed among the travelers during the flight seemed to linger, as strangers exchanged pleasantries and recounted their uneventful journey.

And so, Flight DL215 from San Francisco to Boston concluded just as it had begun - with a sense of serenity and normalcy that defied the expectations of flight tales often shared. No disruptive incidents, no dramatic twists, only the hum of engines and the shared experience of a journey from one corner of the country to another. In the end, it was the quiet beauty of the ordinary that left a lasting impression on the passengers, reminding them that even in our bustling world, there is magic in the unremarkable.

While going through security my seat assignment briefly changed to D1 then changed back. Security took forever that day and I got to the gate towards the tail-end of general boarding. As I scanned my boarding pass the machine beeped and the gate agent seemed shocked that I was boarding the plane. She said I had a Delta One upgrade and asked me if I wanted it. What a dumb question. She said she had called my name repeatedly (before boarding I guess) and because I didn't come up to the counter she gave my upgrade to someone else but yet I could still have it, she was kind of cagey about it. She def wanted me to just keep my current seat and keep going. It took 2 agents to figure out how to switch my seat to D1 and they both kept asking me if I wanted to just keep my regular seat. I said no I'd like the upgrade and actually give it to my girlfriend please.

So my girlfriend took D1 and I ended up in Premium Select next to a Delta employee on vacation who said she was supposed to get upgraded to D1 but someone showed up for it at the last second, which was me.

Totally weird, was it b/c my girlfriend and I were on the same itinerary and there was only 1 upgraded, so the gate agents needed confirmation? Or were they just being shady?

Never heard of losing an extremely valuable upgrade for not being at the gate prior to start of boarding.",mster_shake,175,1119,delta

1ally6d,2024-02-08 11:19:20,~$10k Delta One Seat broken for 10 hour flight. Offered $100 compensation.,"Hi Delta friends,

I am a loyal skymiles member for roughly a decade and have always been impressed by Delta‚Äôs attention to customer service. Last week, I traveled in Delta One for a cross-Atlantic flight and on my trip home my headrest detached shortly after takeoff. For context, these were the recently redesigned Delta One seats with the small shoe cubby in front of you. This Airbus had the 2-2-2 Delta One configuration. 

The crew attempted multiple times to re-attach the headrest no avail. As a result, I had to either hold the headrest up with my shoulders or allow it to lean against my head while seated in a semi/upright position. This is not a small or light headrest for context. See the attached photos. Also, being that I am 6‚Äô4‚Äù, the headrest is very important to seat comfort and unfortunately cannot be avoided when sitting in the seat. 

Given I was visibly uncomfortable, the flight crew told me they would compensate me for the broken seat and inconvenience. Upon arriving home, I received an email letting me know I had been compensated $100 in skymiles. Given the duration of the flight and discomfort along with the hefty price tag for Delta One, I did not find 1% to be adequate and called customer service. I was told on the line from the main representative and her manager that there was nothing they could do due to the flight crew awarding the compensation and that ‚Äúit is policy.‚Äù I am extremely disappointed to have received this collective level of service and lack of quality from what is supposed to be the premier seating offered by Delta. I will also note that I was not the only passenger with seat issues during this long flight‚Äîanother passenger had his seat get stuck in the lay flat position and was unable to have it sit back up. Flight attendants fought with it for roughly an hour before the passenger could comfortably return to an upright position.

Flyers beware of the new Delta One seats. Recommend going with another airline or waiting until Delta can properly check equipment before flying.",B1Turb0,352,1519,delta

1g4x75i,2024-10-16 19:34:45,What to do after hitting Diamond as frequent work traveller but frugal personal traveller?,"Never been in this kind of situation before lol so curious how to proceed. I started a job about a year ago that has me traveling a LOT and depending on the specific trip I can fly Delta One. In 2024 I've earned $22k MQDs/150k miles from work and $1k MQDs/8k miles from personal travel. Realistically I think I could get about ~$20k MQDs/yr just from work, this year was just particularly busy.

I got Gold earlier in the year, my current trip got me to Platinum, and I'm less than 5k MQDs from Diamond (which I will probably get before EOY with work or work+personal).

Since work pays for my work trips, I'm just trying to optimize for my personal travel. I'm pretty cheap and will usually just fly the cheapest route, but now that I have these Delta perks I'll probably start choosing Delta unless it's way more expensive than JetBlue/etc. So I have some questions for you guys who have done more research and are more familiar with this stuff:

- what choice benefit do you recommend for Platinum and Diamond?
- how often do you actually get upgraded in Plat/Diamond? I don't want to spend more on Main Cabin over Basic Economy if the odds of an upgrade are unlikely.
- how do Delta's perks compare overall to other airlines? should I consider booking work travel on another airline for better benefits?
- is the Delta Amex worth the investment since I already have a high status?

For context I live in Manhattan, NYC (my main airport is JFK though I suppose Delta also flies out of LGA?) and fly a pretty even mix of domestic and intl.",Jaded_Champion_7932,13,5,delta

At gate, am checking in passport, getting coach seat assignment.  In front of me is a bearded, tall Emerirati GA, manning the desk.  He is being verbally beaten up by a what we call now, a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù.  She was pulling all the stops to demand a business class upgrade for free- because she was an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù and needed more space.  She got louder, and more personal in her attitude towards this foreign gate agent, doing his job, in his own country.  He mentioned she could buy a seat upgrade for the price- but that got her into swearing mode.  He at that point, handed her a ticket, and said, firmly- Good day.  Have a good flight.‚Äù  She swore more, and literally stomped off.  I waited.  He grabbed a coffee, decomposed for about 3 minutes.  I hobble up to the desk- and he looks to his right- and sees Karen glowering at him in the first row of chairs.  I hand overvmy passport, and docs, and under my breath, mutter, ‚ÄúWhat a jerk. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I look up, and his whole demeanor changes. A broad smile across his face, with a slight twinkle of revenge in his eyes, says loudly enough for her to hear, ‚ÄúOh, Mr. Smith- I see you have injured your leg.  This is a 16 hour flight- and I just found that we have a seat that can accommodate your needs.‚Äù  He then types a few keystrokes, and prints a new boarding pass.  I‚Äôm jazzed, thinking I just went from coach to economy plus- which would really help my leg.

Enjoy your flight!‚Äù  Karen was red in the face mad.  I shook his hands- he winked- and I slept all the way home from Dubai.

1fzco8p,2024-10-09 06:37:12,Any tips on getting reimbursement from Delta for flights booked on other airlines during the Crowdstrike outage?,My family of 4 was flying from Rome to Denver with a layover at JFK on 7/20/24 during the Crowdstrike outage. We all checked in for our flight in Rome. Three of us received boarding passes for the JFK to DEN leg but my 14 year old son did not. The first leg of the flight was operated by ITA. We checked at the ITA desk in Rome and were told that we would have to check with Delta at JFK for my son's boarding pass. Upon landing at JFK we were informed that my son's seat to DEN was given away to another passenger.  I believe that they gave his seat away since he was on a separate itinerary and may have appeared to be an unaccompanied minor. I then gave up my seat so my son would not be stranded in NYC all alone. The Delta ticketing agent could not get us on a Delta flight until 7/23/24 and advised us to book on another airline if we could which is what we did. Now Delta has not reimbursed or refunded us despite the fact that our case seems to be covered by Delta's Temporay Global IT Outage waiver. Our case is supposedly under review with their Customer Care team but they don't respond to emails and I have been unable to talk to a live person from the Customer Care team. Delta has told us to go thru the travel agency that the tickets were purchased thru which we did but the claim was denied. Any advice?,RunAronRun,4,3,delta

My husband and I just got back from what was supposed to be a super special first-class trip for our one-year anniversary, but it turned into a bit of a nightmare thanks to Virgin Atlantic. üò© We booked everything a year in advance to make sure it‚Äôd be perfect, but things went completely sideways when we were flying back from Rome to NYC.

The wild part? We booked through Virgin Atlantic, but they had us on an ITA Airways flight from Rome to London City‚Ä¶ and then our connecting flight to NYC was from Heathrow! Who in their right mind books a 2-hour layover when the two airports are 1.5 hours apart?! We only found out about this mess thanks to a rep at the Rome airport who called it out. Apparently they had changed our plane last minute and we didn‚Äôt realize they were arriving and departing from two different airports. Of course, we missed our connecting flight, had to rebook, stay overnight in a hotel, and ended up stuck in seats next to the noisy lavatory instead of the first-class seats we‚Äôd originally booked. üò§

To top it off, we didn‚Äôt get the meals we requested (first-class perks, am I right?), and the rebooked flight got us home much later than planned. Not the anniversary experience we‚Äôd envisioned in first class, to say the least.

For anyone who‚Äôs dealt with something similar, how does the Virgin Atlantic complaint process work? I want to make sure we actually get heard and hopefully compensated for the extra expenses and all the inconvenience. Any tips on how to approach it or what to expect?

Thanks in advance! ‚úàÔ∏èüõë

I look at her and say ‚Äúseriously?‚Äù And she responds ‚Äúseriously.‚Äù acting like she was annoyed by the question.

In my opinion this was both unprofessional and disrespectful. It was much more annoying to access my laptop and anything in my bag because it was now it was above my head and I have someone else‚Äôs stupid bag in front of me.

I've had the Delta reserve card for 2 years and really like the card as I usually travel with a checked bag and usually get a seat upgrade.

I travel about 20-25 times a year all over the U.S. and really like the atmosphere, food and staff at Delta lounges.  I've only stood in line behind 4 people once at a major airport so not experienced the delays others have experienced.  I usually pop in to the lounge before takeoff and occasionally after arrival for a quick bite.

Since the lounge visits will be limited next year I would like to see what people are doing?  Dumping the card to send a message to management?  Or switching to Amex Plat or other card for Centurion lounge access?  

I'm kind of torn but may keep the card and purchase membership once I use up the 15 visits.  ",psiqt481b,13,5,delta

Yes, we can talk to the GA and ask people to switch seats (and likely end up the reason someone posts on this sub about terrible parents asking for a seat switch), but we shouldn‚Äôt have to when we have the programming capability to prevent it.

I travel weekly typically. When I started the job in 2023, I decided to be loyal to delta. I didn't fly as much my first year but was able to hit gold status near the end of the year after about \~25 flights or so. With the change in to the status earning this year (basically only MQDs matters), I've taken over 40 flights but still in silver with (\~$8500 MQDs). I still have gold status from last year and I think I will hit gold status again by the end of the year... but this has been really frustrating. I mainly am taking \~2 hour flights for work that aren't the priciest so I'm not racking up MQDs as quickly. I was also mainly getting comfort plus seats but this doesn't seem to have helped too much. I have an Amex platinum card (basically my work expense card), but do not want to be forced to get a bunch of Delta credit cards to try and get more MQDs. I've enjoyed delta for the most part but I'm considering switching to another airline. I've only really flown southwest, so I'm not familiar if the benefits/status with other airlines are worth looking into? If delta is really the best airline, I will consider staying. But I find it pretty ridiculous that one could fly this much and only have the first tier of status. As a note, I don't live in a delta hub though I can find direct flights for most of my work trips. Any thoughts or insights are appreciated! I'm still fairly new to the travel job life, but it is a huge pain so I would like as much return as I can get from my airline of choice.

1g4dans,2024-10-16 01:28:52,Companion Certificate with Amex Card is a fraud,"They will do everything they can to NOT LET YOU USE THE CERTIFICATE for any flight you really want to take.

I was trying to use it for a flight to Maui from San Antonio.    However, the online system would not accept my certificate.  I did a chat with an agent, who claimed that Hawaii is not included, only the lower/contiguous 48 States, even though my Terms and Conditions clearly state ""the United States"".  She gives me the link to file a complaint.  So I files a complaint.

I get an email back responding to my complaint.  They include a link to the Companion Certificate info website, and copy some verbiage, highlighting that ""Any Companion Certificates issued prior to February 1, 2024 are eligible for redemption on flights within the 48 contiguous United States. Residents of Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands must originate from those locations to the 48 contiguous United States.""

Guess what idiots at Delta, my certificate was issued after Feb. 1, 2024.  So the whole point of your reply to me was invalid.  Neither your chat agent, nor your agent who replied to my complaint knew your policy.  Neither knew Hawaii was included.

So I email them back and make this point.  Then I get a phone call.  Very nice lady by the way.  She did a good job and I did give her a ""5"" saying yes I would hire this agent at my company rating.  it's not her fault she works at an idiot company.  

She acknowledges that my certificate was indeed issued after Feb. 1, 2024.  She gets ticketing on the line and they collectively figure out that Hawaii is included.  Then she tries to book to Maui on the dates I need (I've already booked the resort) and it won't work.  She tries Honolulu for those dates and it would work.  She gets ticketing on the line again and they figure out that ""the fare classes included in the companion certificate are not available for the travel dates you chose.  However, they are available 2 days earlier (e.g., a Thursday, instead of a Saturday).""   The flights on the dates I was booking were nowhere near full.  When I did seat selection, the entire Main section was empty.  How can they not have ""the fare classes allowed under the companion certificate"" available on those days.  This is a bait and switch rip-off.  ""Oh.. that is the travel date you want... well you can't use your certificate that day.""

I had saved my companion certificate for this Hawaii trip because it would have saved me $800.  I could have used it on a recent trip to Philadelphia 9well...maybe I could have used it) where it would have saved me $600.  In the end, I ended up using it to fly kids home from college for Christmas.  Saved $400.  It's not nothing, but holy cow.  I've spent 4-5 hours on this.  chatting online with their help desk, trying to book online, writing my complaint and my response to their response to my complaint, plus the time on the phone today.  It shouldn't be this hard.  In the end, they won because I got minimum value for my certificate.

18at63h,2023-12-05 04:16:30,10 Truths from my 90 Flights in 2023 -,"90 flights this year. 150,000 flown miles. 

I've been on a Delta (mostly) airplane every four days this year. I've visited all 4 corners of this great country, sometimes in really illogical configurations. I've flown through 8 of the top 10 busiest airports in America.

I really enjoy reading this sub for the gossip and the big stories and the ways people get totally hysterical because they got one sugar instead of two in their coffee and go on ""FIRE ED!"" rampage campaigns. Basically, this sub is like watching reality TV =0)  


And, to calm it all down, here are my truths - 

1) 86 of my 90 flights were roughly on time (within 30 minutes). 

2) Of the 4 that were not, they all sorted themselves out within a few hours. I read my book.

4) The Delta lounges are crowded, and the food isn't very good, so why do people get so hurt about the idea that some people might be kept out of them? If you think the food is good...what on earth do you normally eat? Hungryman frozen dinners?

5) The American and Alaska lounges are awesome. Never crowded, and have better food. The food is still not very good. It's an airport, none of the food is very good.

6) On average, the service I've received on my flights has been average. Some has been great, some has been not very good. Most has been fine. 

7) A few people asked me to switch seats with them. Sometimes I said yes, and sometimes I said no. No further consequences occurred.  Once it was a ""double swap."" I swapped and then swapped again! Wheee! 

8)  Once, I accidentally sat in the wrong seat. The person to whom the seat belonged said- ""I'm sorry, I think you're in my seat."" I looked at the boarding pass, realized they were correct, and moved. This is the entire story.

9) \*Always\* call, \*never\* text. The phone agents are a million times more useful than the chat agents. If you get a bad phone agent, simply hang up and call back, they don't take notes about you.

10) Delta employs 100,000 people. There is no one person whose actions represent the entire company.  Except Ben. Fuck Ben, I'm never flying Delta again because Ben was mean to me in the baggage office that one time.

11) Bonus - the big 3 have divided the country into quadrants, so there is almost zero competition. Unless your home base is LAX or NYC, you only \*have\* one option, so why do we try to pretend we could take our business elsewhere even if we wanted to?

Looking forward to all the tea ya'll are gunna spill next year!

&gt;AirTrain Station 1 will close on October 15, at approximately 8 A.M. through Friday, October 25^(th), 11 A.M. due to construction.

&gt;Free shuttle buses will be provided between Terminal 1 and AirTrain Federal Circle Station. AirTrain will remain operational and continue to serve Terminals 4, 5, 7 and 8 in addition to Federal Circle, Jamaica, and Howard Beach AirTrain stations.

&gt;Customers connecting from other terminals or parking garages to Terminal 1 will need to take AirTrain to Federal Circle Station and transfer to the shuttle bus on the lower level.

&gt;During this service change, passengers may experience longer wait times and increased passenger volumes. Please leave an additional 30 minutes to reach Terminal 1.

&gt;We apologize for any inconvenience as we build an entirely new JFK.

In other words, you'll have to take the AirTrain from Terminal 4 to Federal Circle (which is two miles from the nearest terminal), then take a bus shuttle from there two miles back to Terminal 1.

1d9ysrf,2024-06-07 09:27:00,Delta brought me to tears today.,"These two SLC Delta employees are GODDESSES. Gino (GA) and Kelly (Redcoat) were working this delayed flight to Seattle like total pros. The original equipment had mechanical issues and somehow they found a new plane with the same configuration, moved to a new gate and got us in the air just one hour later. 

But wait, there‚Äôs more. 

I did not have any intention of flying to Seattle tonight. But on my flight from Oakland to Phoenix, I received word that my elderly mother had been rushed to the hospital in Seattle. So I called Delta from Salt Lake and asked if I could be re-routed to Seattle. The 6:10 flight was fully booked, so they put me on the 9:30pm departure and put me on standby for the 6:10. They charged me nothing to do this. (!!!!) When I arrived at the gate and spoke to Gino, she already knew about my situation and said she would do everything to get me on the flight. 

At the end of boarding, two passengers hadn‚Äôt showed. These two goddesses called the passenger‚Äôs cell phones, called the SkyClub, had them paged in the airport (twice), and truly went out of their way to make sure they got on the flight. And they did! 

And so did I. I was one of the last to board, and Gino told me I‚Äôd have to check my bag. No problem. I‚Äôll do anything you say! ü§™ But then Kelly grabbed my bag and said ‚Äúlet me see what I can do.‚Äù  She walked me onto the plane, and on our way we commiserated about elderly parents (nobody warns you!!!), and of course I started crying again. She told me that another passenger had given up his seat for me (thank you to whoever you are!) and  when I asked her if there was any way I could thank him, she said ‚ÄúOh we just paid him off.‚Äù What!! I didn‚Äôt even know they do things like that.

And I cried even more. Total blubbering mess. 

Just. WOW. 

I know, this is really long.

Having read the horror stories, I immediately asked where he was sitting. Of course, middle seat.

179a7ey,2023-10-17 00:33:33,Offered 700 to give up seat then revoked when I got off the plane.,"So I‚Äôm pretty annoyed today. I recently had a flight where I was offered 700 to give up my seat.

 I was already aboard the plane and a gate agent came on and offered me a gift card to catch the next plane out of ATL to my destination. 
I figured sure why not I could use the money Christmas is coming up. 

So when I got off the plane and went to get my card I was then told I was not eligible for the gift card. 
Me being absolutely confused and asked them why and they told me it was due to my standby status. Should that even matter? 

I did everything I was supposed to and got my seat assignment and was on the plane. The agent said they would refer to their manager whom also said no I am not getting a gift card but maybe they could give me a meal voucher wtf? 
I have sky club why would I even want that. 

Fast forward to the customer care team messaging app and they offer me 5000 sky pesos and asked if that was cool. I said no I just want what I was promised they then said we will call you. 

So Im on the phone with a support member who tells me that they can offer me 200 dollars in credit or 20000 sky miles for the miscommunication. 

There was no miscommunication but that‚Äôs what the gate agent wrote in my file saying that they misspoke when they offered me the 700. So not only was I lied to and cheated out of my seat the agents also lied about what transpired. 

The cherry on top though was when I finally did get on a plane to head to my destination the plane had a maintenance issue that kept us on the tarmac for another hour in the luxurious crj 900. 

Anyone else had something similar happen or know how to escalate this issue to someone who can actually get what was promised?

1flh2eh,2024-09-21 01:06:15,"People who don‚Äôt shower before flights, y‚Äôall are some as*holes. ","Sitting by the window seat flying back from ATL to PHX and an older guy and his wife (late 50‚Äôs) sit next to me. The guy sits in the middle, wife on the isle. His elbow is already spilling over the middle armrest and touching me‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs whatever‚Ä¶.

What I can‚Äôt get over is the smell. Not the smell of overpowering B.O. but the smell of someone who is certainly getting to that point. Someone who maybe took a shower yesterday morning and did their activities yesterday, went to bed without showering and then woke-up and headed to the airport.

I see the threads on Reddit talking about how many showers is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in a week and while I disagree with the people saying they take a shower 2-3 times a week, if they want to live in their smell that‚Äôs their business. When you bring it on the plane though? In a cramped group of people? Take a damn shower. No one wants to smell you - even if a shower before the flight doesn‚Äôt fit your ‚Äúshower schedule‚Äù - do it for the common courtesy of others. You may think you don‚Äôt smell, but if you‚Äôve gone more than 18-24hours without a shower I can promise you, you do have a smell. I‚Äôve yet to encounter one that‚Äôs ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù. 

EDIT: to be clear, this isn‚Äôt a minority. This isn‚Äôt a situation where their cultural differences could lead to this. These are two older very white Americans that (at least the guy) definitely did not shower. It reminds me when I used to help at the old folks home, when they were not bathed regularly they had this ‚Äúsmell‚Äù even though they were not very active in between their baths. 

2ND EDIT:  while I understand that there are people who are on back to back flights, or just coming off work which can make showering difficult - these are locals visiting their son in AZ, I‚Äôve overheard the wife talking about it with the people in front of them. ",DrAbeSacrabin,489,3164,delta

1dwbvz4,2024-07-06 07:38:44,Please stop with the lounge tipping and gift-giving,"This might be a controversial take, but I find that tipping culture in the US has gone completely out of control. And lately, on this sub I've been seeing so many absurd posts and stories about tipping in lounges or giving gifts to FAs.

* The right way to recognize employees is through the [Delta feedback site](https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview) by sharing a compliment. This is the official channel and directly rewards the FAs being recognized.
   * Quite frankly, it is very tacky to start handing out random gifts to FAs, not to mention there are weirdos in this world, so it's generally just best practice for people to not accept random gifts (especially if it's food) from strangers
* Delta makes [billions of dollars in profits](https://ir.delta.com/news/news-details/2024/Delta-Air-Lines-Announces-March-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx) every year thanks to their exorbitant ticket prices. It is not the average person's responsibility to make sure Delta's employees are compensated fairly and paid a livable wage.
   * Tipping in general is just a bad practice and not accepted in most other countries to begin with for very good reasons.

At the end of the day, most people generally have good intentions with these gestures, but not only are they unnecessary, they perpetuate bad practices.

The bottom line is just be polite and respectful in your interactions or requests. Thank your lounge and flight attendants appropriately and submit compliments online for when they do a good job.

Edit: it seems many people are unaware that employees are recognized by management and directly rewarded through the use of the online feedback system. So for those that are mocking it, know that this is the reason why it's important to use it.",srekai,584,1371,delta
1cqqhbl,2024-05-13 12:12:44,Be aware of roller bag swipers! ATL to MDW,"So I encountered a first in my 10 years of flying with Delta.

On the 3rd attempt as he had his hand on my leather bag side handle as he was pulling it down to deplane with it, I raised my voice and clearly articulated that it was my bag and put my hand on the bag to stop the movement. 

No apologies from this guy he just said he was getting the bag down for his ‚Äòcompanion‚Äô who then proceeded to deplane without a roller bag.

I‚Äôve seen mixups but my bag is unique, and not like the traditional black tumi bags you see everywhere. 

From my perspective it was a blatant attempt at trying to swipe someone else‚Äôs bag. From the way he first went up without looking and just put his hands on the handle, to repositioning it in the overhead space to make it easier to quickly take down.

This doesn't surprise me, given PNS is regional and stranger things have happened to me personally flying out of there on multiple occasions. 

Still, after takeoff, her baby was a little fussy but I noticed he was taking a liking to my tattoos - even reaching out to touch me but the mom was apologetic.  Decided to ease the tension a bit and let her know it was okay, I know I look a little different/out of place.  After that, it was one of the coolest short haul flights I've been on.  He started getting a little squirmy and I told the mom it was fine if the baby ""came over"" the arm rests as she was doing her best to keep him confined on her lap.  

Right before the seat belt sign came on, I felt little dude's hand on my arm and just saw him smiling away.  I don't know why, but for some reason - this totally got me.  Started talking with him and hearing his little noises was the cutest dang thing.  Got a ""thank you"" from the mom after we landed and even got to hold the little dude while she grabbed her carry on before deplaning.

My flight is tomorrow, 10/19. Four months ago, purchased tix for Premium Select class through Capital One travel portal (first mistake?) with mostly miles on a Virgin Atlantic flight to AMS for my partner's 50th birthday. Tried multiple times to choose seats for JFK-AMS leg on Virgin Atlantic app and website. Was not able to do so. Never had confirmed seats, so finally called VA who advised I call Delta. Delta booked us into Premium Select for JFK-AMS. A day or so later, we each receive a text from Delta advising of an equipment change and we are no longer in Premium Select. Now in Main Cabin.

I call Delta, they can't help. I call Virgin, they can't help. I call Capital One, they can't help. I just want what I paid for MONTHS ago. Delta supervisor tells me on the phone that the ""system"" bumps people by purchase date, so everyone else in Premium Select must have booked before us. I tell the supervisor we were never able to choose seats until recently, so now she says that's why we were bumped. Delta supervisor says ""system"" cannot be overridden by ANYONE at Delta.

1fu7waj,2024-10-02 12:21:26,Weird experience - pulled off a flight tonight...then back on,"Flew from Costa Rica to Atlanta then boarded connecting flight to DCA.

Everything totally normal but after all passengers on board they don't close boarding door.  10-15 min passes and pilot says something about sorry for the delay.

Then a gate agent comes in board and comes to me and asks what seat am I supposed to be sitting in.   I'm like ""this one."". He questions again and I tell him I would be glad to show my boarding pass.  

5 min later he comes back and asks if I came from Costa Rica and I said yes.  He says well I do need to see you boarding pass and passport.  I give it and he takes it off the plane.   Another 6-8 minutes passes and I'm getting nervous about what the hell is going on and why did he take my passport.  

Finally he comes back and says i need to get my bags and come to the gate to ""sort it out."".  I'm like ""sort what out."". He wouldn't answer directly with what the problem is.  

He said I was not flying and pulled me off the plane and held my passport.  The guy said ""I don't even know how you got on the plane"".  I said I scanned my pass, computer beeped and I got on.  

After I got off they closed and locked the boarding door.   

They told me I would be booked for tomorrow and to see lady at gate counter.  I pushed for an explanation and he said she will explain.  I went to desk and lady ignored me for like 2-3 min and I was getting pretty annoyed that they took my passport and were not telling me what was going on.  I forced her to talk to me and she said ""I'm working on it"".    I said I needed to know what is going on and she just kept pecking her keyboard and not looking at me.  Then the guy came back and I told both of them more sternly that they needed to tell me what the hell is going in.  Then guy told me to calm down they are working on it.  I'm like working on what?!?   What is the problem?   You have to start telling me what is going on.  The lady finally stops pecking at keyboard and the guy says ok let's go and takes me back down the jet bridge and he literally knocked on the pilot's window and had them reopen the boarding door and I board.  Pushing back from gate now.  Still no real explanation of what the problem was.   Passengers all curious what I am doing and likely annoyed that I held up the whole flight.

I still have no idea what happened.  

Also....when they tell you once the door closes it will not reopen..  not true apparently.  ",l00sem4rble,104,2163,delta

I opened another Amex delta plat back in July of this year and have not received the MQD Headstart for that card. 

I‚Äôve called AMEX multiple times about this. 
Once after 8 weeks passed since it‚Äôs stated that it can take 6-8 weeks to get it. Amex rep said they have reports of customers not receiving the MQD and instructed me to wait till 12 weeks have passed. 

Called AMEX again after 12 weeks and that rep stated they had to follow some procedure to manually place it in and it will take 10 days. 

I call AMEX again after 10 days and this rep now states that only one $2,500 MQD Headstart is allowed per SkyMiles number and to call Delta about it. 

I was under the impression that you get $2,500 MQD per Amex product such as:
- AMEX delta reserve: $2,500
- AMEX delta plat: $2,500
- AMEX delta reserve business: $2,500
- AMEX delta plat business: $2,500


Is this no longer the case or was the AMEX rep misinformed?  Do members now only get one $2,500 benefit per SkyMiles account no matter how many different Amex products you have?

Any advice?

Got a huge response and a ton of great info from you all, including some PMs and whatnot, which my family massively appreciated. Wanted to share what we did before I forget, in case anyone else ends up in this ungodly situation- namely flying cross-country with two broken legs fixed at the knee with external rods. 

We called in a lot and utilized Delta‚Äôs customer service ‚Äúsupervisors‚Äù who have the ability to manage medical situations and make ticket notes that ensure the FAs and airport agents have a clear view of the game plan, and tickets aren‚Äôt messed with inadvertently later on. These people are angels. We got 5 seats as my dad needed 3 to sit across (perpendicular to aisle) and my mom and I needed one each. Delta gave us a medical fare which came to $2k for 5 seats (including 3 in comfort+) from SLC-RDU. No idea the market rate but I am sure it was 1.5-2x as high so this was huge. Although we were skiing in Utah we are a far cry from rich, which ruled out all the private flight ideas.

At first we were going to use 10A-C (bulkhead) for him, but we found out at gate that those armrests don‚Äôt raise. They switched him to the row behind that where they go up. We were anxious as he only technically had 2 ticketed comfort+ seats (other three we had were main), but gate agents had no problem shuffling, they were great. In fact my mom and I ended up with a full aisle so I suppose we had six seats. We brought pillows, blankets etc, and used seatbelt extender to make it more comfortable. 

For transport to airport we got a one-day rental of an amazing minivan with a ramp, tie downs, etc. $150 for the day in SLC, which blew my mind- thing is state of the art and costs not much more than the SUV we rented in SLC to ski. We have a similar van in RDU to get him home. Had a great wheelchair bought in SLC to get him to plane, then stowed that and used the aisle chair to get to seats. 

For the clotting risk he was prescribed lovenox shots (all thru hospital stay) and got a small booster this morning before flight.

That‚Äôs it really. Couldn‚Äôt get up during flight so had to be intentional with bathroom planning but a 4hr flight was doable.

Plane was nice-ish. I considered if the retro vibe is part of the new branding, but the dated technology and non working WiFi tipped me off that it was just old. But I did get to play space invaders on the built in screen so that was cool. 
The latch for my tray table broke mid-flight. Annoying but probably my fault in retrospect. 
Food was fine, much more British inspired than on a regular delta flight (sausage and mash, scone with clotted cream). Tea breaks galore but they seemed surprised when I asked for wine instead. 
Somehow I didn‚Äôt get up for the whole flight, and my bum was very sore from sitting that long. Not sure I can directly blame the seats but normally I don‚Äôt notice any pain. 
Headphones were crummy over the ear type with cheap foam and often disconnected from the Jack. 
Definitely not the same booze vibe as delta - cans of wine rather than enormous bottles. 
Seemingly a lot less communication than regular delta - like less announcements during the flight. 
Not as dark as I expected. Coming back to US is of course different because it‚Äôs not overnight, but it felt bright the whole time. 
Seats reclined really far which I didn‚Äôt really notice until the person in front of me returned their seat to its full upright position but all things considered it was probably better reclined because once it was up, my broken tray table was significantly more annoying. 

Screens had some privacy layer so I couldn‚Äôt see what my husband was watching (neither bad or good I suppose?)

Red Coat was eventually called, and as she walked up the woman starts with ‚Äúwe are NOT leaving, understand? We are not getting off this flight.‚Äù

I had booked our poor man‚Äôs first class months ago, seats 13 E/F and chose the same seats going to SAT and returning to ATL.  If you know the layout of the A321‚Äôs these are C+ seats in the exit row and it‚Äôs the one row that has just 2 passenger seats and a jump seat for the flight attendant.

So, now I‚Äôm going thru my memory to choose the best statement I have read on this board to hit them with when we get close enough.  Do I choose something polite?  Something snarky?  Or do I just go DEFCON 1 and let them have it??

Well, as I mentioned, the flight attendant was standing right there next to them and my wife was in front of me. Before I can say anything, she calmly shows the flight attendant our  boarding passes and looks at the 2 guys who are still having their loud conversation.  The flight attendant interrupts them and asks them for their boarding passes, which they now start fumbling to find and of course they are supposed to be several rows back and both in middle seats no less.

She says loudly (just as they were being loud before)‚Ä¶‚ÄùGentleman, it‚Äôs very important to check your seating assignments so that everyone is in their proper seats. Now please move back and find your correct row and seats‚Äù.   She also said it so loud that people further down the aisle  and half those on board in their seats turned around to see what was going on, lol.

Of course both stand up and start mumbling something about Delta must have changed their seats or the layout of their planes and they begin to move back.

My wife and I were booked in Delta One and they were unable to book get us to hawaii until the next day and flew us to SNA that night and then to Hawaii the next morning, not in lay down seats. 

They offered a credit to everyone on the flight, but my wife and I still feel like we were totally taken advantage of having to miss a day of our trip and then getting rebooked without having our lay down delta one seats because all of delta‚Äôs flights were full.

Can someone explain this to me in pain human English?

Questions:

1) What does ‚ÄúRegional‚Äù mean? I assume it means not international. But what about say MSP to Orlando?

3) It looks like these can only be used when booked via Delta Vacations? I‚Äôve never used this service. Does it cost more? Can you book only flights?

Should I just cancel now and rebook as a one way, or is there any downside to just taking the first leg and canceling while I‚Äôm in Michigan? Will I just get the skymiles of that leg back?

UPDATE - I called delta after finally getting through, and just for awareness what they stated was the following: If i took the first leg and needed to cancel, i would only get a skymiles credit that could be applied ONLY to a future MI to Texas flight. So the downside to waiting for Option 2 is you are much more restricted, whereas OPtion 1 below refunds as skymiles you can use anywhere. I was leaning towards Option 2 but then furhter evidence from others here indicate the agent was just straight up wrong. So if Option 2 was real, I'd take it but it seems like you do NOT get your skymiles refunded on the cancelled return leg

EDIT: Total for flight was 30K skymiles. 13k on front end, 17k on back leg. I can rebook the front end for 20k right now

Option 1: Cancel all and rebook the 20K. I save 10K

This guy held a zoom conference call for roughly 1 hour and 44 minutes (based on when I noticed to when he stopped) across from us. We used headphones, but his voice only seemed to have one volume (megaphone).

Admittedly, his suit and haircut looked immaculate, and his business salesmanship and bullshitting was next level. I (and the rest of FC and probably the first 10 rows of MC) all got a nice insight into how the CEO really works some worried investors/partners (he wasn't using headphones btw, even though the FA offered - I think he thought the wires would make him look stupid).

Why wouldn't he reschedule the call to when he's on the ground or in the lounge? Is this okay? The flight atttendant asked him twice to lower his voice as it was a 6AM flight and most passengers were trying to sleep. But despite his nods of understanding, whenever it was his turn to speak, he'd amp it up to ""I'm the eldest boy"" volume.

1g3qtrq,2024-10-15 05:07:34,3 tickets for the same flight for 1 person.,"I had booked a flight from ATL to FLL around the end of September. I ended up with 3 tickets to the same flight, all for me.

BACKGROUND:

I work as a sailor in the yachting industry, so for me, going home doesn't also work out as precisely as our contracts state.  It should be 10 week ""on""- basically on the ship and working, and 10 weeks ""off""- repatriated home/ do whatever you'd like in your off time. I am working on upgrading my licenses, so I spend quite a bit of time in FLL doing continuing education.

As my time on the ship winds up, I begin to book classes, flights and accommodation for furthering my career.

I booked a fully refundable trip in MC. As the days tick by and I know I'll be back in the states, I pounce. I cancel my refundable ticket and book a regular MC ticket. Since I was at sea at the time that I booked the ticket, I was surprised when the DELTA app showed two fights for the same day. 

I decided to wait it out and give the matrix 48 hours to get its bits and bytes in order. 

When I was back in the US, I checked the app again only to see that it still appeared to show 2 tickets for the same flight. I called the customer service, and the unraveling began.

It seems with the piss poor internet I had (can't really complain, being able to have internet at sea in AMAZING) the website had booked 2 tickets (no idea how, the representative said she hadn't seen this before, and perhaps the delay had caused the app to time out and then book 2 tickets at once).

She couldn't even see the 3rd ticket on my account, I had to give all 3 confirmations numbers for them to find it, she was able to refund the refundable ticket (duh) and then had to offer me DELTA credit for the other ticket since it was a regular MC flight. 

Has this happened to anyone? I'm grateful that I could get the credit, and that I can afford to eat the full cost of a ticket. But I still don't understand how Delta allows a single passenger with the same SkyMiles account buy 3 tickets ON THE SAME FLIGHT.

1f3n2l8,2024-08-29 06:53:53,Psycho,"Today boarding my flight out of Boston, I was zone 5 and waited appropriately. 

First class was well settled in and full, so having flown a few 1,000 times, I utilized the available space. To my surprise, a feeble old woman with headphones on, announced to the cabin that I was not eligible to use this space. 

I comply to not further piss off the pretensions of said psychopath, and the private space she apparently was entitled to, yet not using. (All the bins in C+ and the first 10 rows of main were closed, duh, zone 5).

Mere moments later the FA announced to ‚ÄúUSE ALL AVAILABLE SPACE DONT BRING YOUR BAGS BACK HERE!‚Äù. 

Remember, karma is best served bitchy with a lot of salt. This lady lost it, even clapping back at the FA, who personally took my bag and placed in the exact bin I had previously occupied while a dozen other passengers opened every bin to cram as much as possible into the overhead bins in First.

She. Was. Fuming.

1devm9h,2024-06-13 18:19:47,Help! Delta keeps giving my extra seat away.,"ETA - I informed both ticketing agents that I had two seats when boarding and they both said I would have both seats only to end up giving my second seat away.

First class isn't an option as I'm traveling for work and they won't pay for it.

Yesterday I traveled for work from Dayton, OH to Miami with a NIGHTMARE of a layover in Atlanta.

I booked two seats for myself because I'm a bigger gal and I don't want to inconvenience myself or my neighbor by encroaching into their seat. We boarded our 3:03pm flight on time, I showed both boarding passes to the ticketing agent and she scanned my first seat and then kept the boarding pass for my second seat. I haven flown in years so I have no idea what the second seat procedure is so I just went ahead and boarded. 

Well, after it appeared that everyone was on board, a very sweet woman showed up saying my second (the middle next to my aisle seat) was hers. Out of embarrassment and not wanting to make a fuss, I stood up and let her sit down and apologized to her for the tight squeeze, which she was very sweet about but I was completely miserable at the prospect of spending the next 90 minutes leaning into the aisle so I wasn't squishing the poor lady. 

Well, after we sat there for s while the captain announced that we had a 3-4 hour delay due to the weather in Miami and they had everyone get off. Since I had time to kill, I messaged Delta from my app letting them know what happened and they apologized and said that shouldn't have happened. They said that my second seat was marked as a no-show so it was given to a standby passenger. They offered to move me and my work colleague to a flight leaving at 4:56, which was better than waiting until 6:30 and they assured me I'd have my two seats and that they had another seat for my colleague i wax traveling with so we took it. Unfortunately  that meant wet had to run to the new gate, about 20 gates away. 

When we got there we found out that flight had been delayed to 8:40 ü´† We waited in line for an hour to try to get our seats back on our original flight that was delayed to 6:30. It was hot and crowded but they were able to get us back on our flight leaving at 6:30- and they assured me that I'd have both seats back- yay!

When we re-boarded the plane, I told the ticketing agent what happened last time and that I needed to make sure they weren't going to give my seat away again- she quickly assured me that I was all set and would have both seats. Keep in mind, this was pretty embarrassing to me to have to keep talking in front of other passengers about my extra seat to accommodate my big butt. But I went ahead and boarded again and everything was going great until, wouldn't you know it, after the plane was full, a guy appeared saying my extra seat was his and his boarding pass confirmed it. I apologized to him for the right squeeze and told him that I had paid for both seats and they had promised me that they wouldn't give the second one away AGAIN. He was really nice and said I should say something to the flight attendant and that he'd be willing to move if there was another spot for him. 

It was humiliating but I grabbed a FA when she walked by and explained what was going on and she was very nice and assured me that I paid for both seats and that I should have both. I said I didn't want them to take the poor guy off the flight or anything but that if they could move him, that would be great. They ended up bringing the ticketing agent that had assured me she wouldn't give my seat away onto the plane and for about 15 minutes she and the FAs talked and looked over boarding passes. Again, I was so embarrassed and feeling terrible that now I was holding up and already delayed flight. They eventually came and got the gentleman and put him somewhere else, thankfully. 

So, now I'm having a lot of anxiety about my flights back home tomorrow, afraid they're going to do the same thing again and I'm going to have to go through the whole embarrassing debacle again.

What can I tell the ticketing agent to make sure this doesn't happen again? I gave them both boarding passes and explained that I needed both seats and they gave my second seat away to a standby passenger, TWICE. Does anyone have any idea what I can do to make sure they don't mark my second seat as a no show again tomorrow? ",Educational_Wasabi90,451,1775,delta

I got silver through work a couple years back due to business and, to be frank, I didn't really get anything out of it other than luggage tags I don't use, (IIRC) extra bags I frequently didn't use, and people coming to talk to me before my flight (I don't like talking before).

  
AFAIK, the REAL benefit from family members is that their agent time is 5 min while mine was around 3 hours back in the day.

Business travel dried up completely during the pandemic and is not anticipated to resume at all.



That all being said, I'm on track to spend a whopping $5900+ on plane tickets by EOY. What are some fun ways to maximize this for a year next year that I'll probably never see again?

ABY is a smell regional airport in south GA with only two commercial flights a day and both to ATL on Delta.

My usual work around is to book the flight via KLM for 8500 points one way.

Well first issue was partially on me.  I forgot to remove my KLM # and put in my Skymiles #.  When I tried to do it the night before, Delta wouldn‚Äôt let me do it because it said I had a ‚Äúlap baby‚Äù (I didn‚Äôt).

So now, when it‚Äôs time to check in - no free checked bag and Zone 7 boarding and no TSA Precheck.

No problem. I arrived early at MCO, got in the Sky Priority Line and got my Skymiles # added and TSA Precheck showed up.

Got to the SkyClub with my new printed ticket and it wouldn‚Äôt scan.  I went to the Delta agent and asked them could they fix whatever was wrong with my ticket.  Once that was fixed, I was able to get on an earlier flight and be in the ATL lounge early enough not to miss a meeting. 

They also fixed my return flight ABY - ATL - MCO.

I got my FC upgrade on the ABY - ATL segment and belatedly noticed that I only had a 35 minute segment.  I spoke to a representative over messaging and they said they couldn‚Äôt change my ABY - MCO flight to the  earlier flight because it was a ‚Äúmarried flight‚Äù.

1g1niws,2024-10-12 07:50:08,Vacation (Partially) Ruined by Delta,"Apologies, had to ad flair so I chose ""Discussion"", bu really I just need to rant.   Because of my wife's work and my daughter's wedding, my wife and I have not take a trip in 2024.   Starting months ago we planned a 11-day trip to Prague, Dresden, and Munich.  We live in Cincinnati.  Delta flies direct to CDG on Thursday evenings at 6:20ish.  Our trip was to begin yesterday.   Mid afternoon we get word from Delta that the flight to CDG was delayed until 9:45 pm.  Thus we would miss our connection that would have gotten us to Prague at 11:45 am.  Now we would arrive in Prague at 7 pm.  We get to the airport, boarding is delayed.  The plane, a 767, had arrived from CDG and had been on the ground in Cincinnati since 4 pm.  We finally board and the flight is to depart at 10 pm according to the app and board at the gate.   We sit on the plane still at the gate because there was an issue with the right engine that ""has been repaired, but now must be tested"".   Multiple ""we're almost ready to get underway"" announcements from the flight deck.  At midnight they say the flight is delayed until 8 am, and everyone is to deplane.   Everyone deplanes and there are loooong lines at the desk at the gate, people trying to rebook.   By the time we get to the desk, at 2 am, the flight is no longer leaving at 8 am, instead the flight will leave at 6:10 pm on Friday, 24 hours after the original flight time.  So we call every hotel in Prague, Dresden and Munich and move check in back a day.  This will only cost us one day.  We'll just shave a half day off Dresden and Munich each.  We get to the airport tonight at 4 pm for the 6:15 flight and stop in the lounge for something to eat.   The boards and app say the flight is boarding at 5:25 and leaving at 6:22.   We go to the gate at 5:15, app still says flight is leaving at 6:22.   When we get to the gate I look out the window and see the cowling on both sides of the engine is up.  Said to wife, that's not good.  Look up at the board at the gate, flight is cancelled again.  

I don't understand a couple of things.   (1) the plane had been on the ground at the gate since 4 pm on Thursday.   Why did they have us board at 10 pm a plane they knew wasn't ready to fly?   Such a mess with the checked baggage, etc. when they cancelled 2 hours later.   (2) on Friday, why was the flight not cancelled until it was time to board?    I get planes are complicated machines and have maintenance issues.   It's just the timing of everything that happened.  Cancelling so late both days left everyone stranded for another day.  And is an equipment change just not a thing that can happen?  Feels like Delta handled this very poorly.   So disappointed to have this trip we've been so looking forward to so screwed up by Delta.  

Credit where it is due, on Thursday night (actually midnight Friday morning to 2 am) the red coats who helped everyone get rebooked were really awesome.  Passengers were also well behaved.   So there's that.  Tomorrow we are going CVG to DTW, DTW to AMS, and AMS to PRG.   Fingers crossed.",rick-in-the-nati,11,0,delta

1g536zh,2024-10-17 00:14:18,Weirdness on DAL451 10/12,"We flew to New York on Saturday and there was some serious weirdness on the flight. The flight attendants said it was a medical emergency that was ""resolved"" and we didn't need to divert. 

Here's what happened:

About two hours into the flight a flight attendant calls for medical personnel. And honestly if I was to get sick on a flight, it would have been this one because like six people ran up to the front.

A bunch of stuff happens and I think they moved the passengers seatmate and swapped in a flight attendant that was dead heading. (I think, she seemed to know the crew and was up to see us all off when we were deplaning but was not in a uniform.)

A different flight attendant ran up to the front with the defibrillator bag and then nothing. I couldn't see exactly what was going on since this was in first and I was in C+ in a window seat.

The foulest stench of shit overcame me at one point. It was awful and there was no one in the lavatory.

Shortly after the defibrillator ran to the front of the plane, the same flight attendant called for a member of the LDS church????

A very tall blonde man ran up to the front of the plane, who I'm guessing was the member of the LDS church.

Lots of activity, some other guy with wrap around sunglasses that LEO and LEO cosplayers like to wear was sort of hovering around the barrier between FC and Comfort+. 

Same flight attendant with the defibrillator also ran through with a sort of orangey-yellow square case thing at one point. 

Things calmed down and the flight attendant got on and said it was ""resolved"" and we were not diverting. According to the flight map we were pretty near-ish Minneapolis and Detroit so I feel like we could have. 

We made our way onto JFK relatively uninterrupted but my husband did say he saw what looked like a saline bag pop up. A little later on they requested a glucometer. 

Just before we started our approach at JFK they told us emergency services were going to be there to help the passenger that had the emergency and please for the love of god (I'm interpreting) could everyone just stay the fuck seated until they sorted it out. Everyone complied and that was all wrapped up in 5 minutes. It was a barely noticeable amount of time.
We we got on the jetway, there was a crew of 10 people with cleaning supplies ready to hop on the plane. 

What we (myself, husband, friend, bartender at the hotel who overheard us talking about this and loves ATC recordings) want  to know is, did someone die?

Edit: also as a side note that was probably the quickest landing and taxi I've ever experienced on a flight into a major airport.

For context, I'm traveling with an elderly family member who's in the initial stages of cognitive decline and becomes quite anxious in stressful situations. There is a flight departing CLT 2 hours earlier which would resolve the time constraint issue, but then I'm concerned about whether that, followed by an 8 hr flight, would be too taxing for my relative.

1f0ad10,2024-08-25 01:12:59,Can we normalize backing each other up when seat changes are requested?,"This recently happened to us while flying to France out of Raleigh. My husband and I had booked our aisle and middle seats together. As soon as we boarded my husband got up to use the bathroom before the pre-flight announcements. As we double-checked our seat location, there was a woman already sitting in the window seat of our row with a baby. As soon as I put my purse in my seat to take off my sweater and settle in, her husband, came over to sit in my husband‚Äôs seat. He looked at me and said ‚ÄúOh, I need to sit next to my wife and baby.‚Äù I responded, without moving out of his way, that it was my husband‚Äôs seat; and he was in the bathroom. He said, ‚ÄúWould he mind sitting in my seat?‚Äù, and proceeds to point all the way towards the back of the plane. 

I immediately responded ‚ÄúI can speak on behalf of my husband and that would be ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.‚Äù They both looked at me with confused looks on their faces like I somehow didn‚Äôt have a right to politely decline. Then they tried to get the flight attendant‚Äôs attention, but as they did that the person sitting directly behind the woman with the baby lifted herself up from her seat and said *‚ÄùIf you knew you were flying with a baby, you should have made sure your seats were booked together.‚Äù*

They both looked at each other, then at the lady behind us, and blankly looked at me, while they mumbled something about trying to do just that, but couldn‚Äôt for whatever reason. By then my husband was back and hers had already walked away. My husband sat down and I quietly told him was had just occurred (in case her husband might come back and ask him himself, or bring the flight attendant over) and he was glad I didn‚Äôt let his seat go. With it being a long flight and him having anxiety about flying, he definitely didn‚Äôt want to be sent to the back of the plane alone, and I definitely didn‚Äôt want to be alone sitting next to a couple with a small baby for hours across the Atlantic. But I was even more appreciative of the woman behind us who spoke up, just because.

*Update: 
Since posting this, it‚Äôs obvious this is a triggering topic for many, so much so that the term ‚Äòseat switching anxiety‚Äô probably best describes it. 

Main takeaways: 
1) It‚Äôs become common to be asked to switch. 
2) It‚Äôs your right to keep the seat; not swapping doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. 
3) In more cases than not, the person asking will have a worse seat than you. 
4) Airlines have perpetuated this problem by charging fees for access to better seats and sometimes don‚Äôt even honor the seat assignment, even when those fees are paid. 
5) FA‚Äôs vary in how they respond, with some asking you to accommodate while others will stand firm in the assigned seating; this is why (as in my case) some people seek out flight attendants when you refuse.*

I missed having IFE but I did enjoy getting the whole can of ginger ale vs just a cup. And yes, both flights were cheaper than Delta. I‚Äôm curious how folks feel when they fly other airlines.",StrangePsychology848,4,0,delta

My first flight gets to LAX 2.5 hours before departure, do I just do it like the old days and proceed to the gate and wait for those agents to show up and volunteer?   Or will I get a lowball offer for doing so, and should just wait until they announce anything?

  
There are two more Delta flights going to my final destination, as well as a couple of other airlines also departing to same destination.

1g7y2rg,2024-10-20 20:56:28,Thank You to Vay (CSR),"Just start by setting the stage. Planned a big trip to Europe this winter with the family. Two separate tickets - bought D1 for the flight out and Prem Select for the return for my wife and I, GUC cleared and we're D1 for the return too! Cashed in my miles to surprise our kids (late teens) with prem select - this is the second ticket since it was with miles. This was all booked a few months ago.

Yesterday, get an email saying the kids were switched to an 8:55 am return from our original 3:30 pm but I didn't see a similar notification for ours. Quickly called the diamond line to see what is up and if we can all be on the same flight.

This is where Vay comes in - she was beyond helpful. From what she communicated, there was an equipment change and schedule change. We could wait would likely see the same notification by Tuesday (seemed like a while to wait in limbo). I asked if there was a way to pre-empt that change and move my wife and I to that earlier flight as well. Took about 30 minutes but she was able to work her magic and get us seats 1A and 2A to boot! We're also now on the A339 versus the A333 - excited to try the real suites for the first time.

We still have 2 months to go so things can always change but in this instance, Vay was incredibly helpful and my family thanks her greatly! Not enough CSRs get praised but I have time and time again found CSRs to be incredibly helpful. I have a feeling most of the time people call in with an attitude and expectations - be nice to each other!

1g8dyab,2024-10-21 09:03:24,Thoughts/advice ,"I currently am Gold Medallion (highest I have been) as I travel monthly for work. I need $2,517 MQD‚Äôs to hit Platinum before the end of the year. I currently have $642 pending. 

With my work travel, it SHOULD be monthly but can vary. I know I for sure will have to go Memphis (DTW is my home base) once more which gives me about $630 MQD‚Äôs. I may have to go twice before the end of the year but I know I will go once more for sure. 

I most likely will have to travel to Orlando at least once before the end of the year which has given me anywhere from $600-$750 MQD. I also have one possible trip to Cali again before the end of the year which gives me anywhere from $600-$650. 

There are so many ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù that factor into my scenario that it‚Äôs hard to plan. Is it worth chasing platinum status? My husband and I do travel as well (especially since I accrue so many miles and hotel points). Just curious what others would think/do in my situation. ",Icy_Two8520,14,1,delta
