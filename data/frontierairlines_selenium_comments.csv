Today, frontier has three options to get from Denver to Orlando. Southwest has 22. Granted, some of those are connections on frontier two of them are the same departing flight out of Denver so if that flight gets canceled your left with one option. In smaller cities, and I mean where frontier has a smaller operation, they often don’t fly the same route every day of the week they’ll fly at three days a week or four days a week. So if your flight is canceled and the flight is full, you’re stuck with a flight three or four days later maybe.

We also plan that if we need to stay an extra day it won’t cause any major issues. We know how frontier can work and plan for worst case scenarios. 

Fortunately we haven’t encountered anything major yet and it helps that my partner and I can work remotely if needed and don’t have any other major responsibilities.

We paid like $100 extra or something iirc to reserve the seats at the front of the plane and we also bought the full row for two of us. The plane boarded early and even though we got there right as boarding was supposed to start, they were already on group 2. No worries, we shoulda been earlier.

Get on the plane and there are people in our seats. We tell the flight attendant, already feeling bad because it might slow down boarding, “oh sorry, we actually purchased these seats.” And she literally said, “Oh there must’ve been some confusion. Well it’s a short flight, you can just sit in these seats.” And pointed at another row. Watching the line of people form behind us and all of the people who already boarded watching us we didn’t want to be Karen’s so we let it slide but that was a “yeah I don’t think we’ll fly frontier again” moment.

I just request a different agent or escalate to a supervisor calmly to get them to follow their own company’s policies.

I can see how stressful that can be and that agent is a POS but you need to be your own advocate these days.

That being said, there's enough of the posts on here where people actually do show up only a few minutes before the cutoff and get mad at the gate agents about it so I'm sure they are almost expecting it most of the time. 

Last week I had 2 flights where I had no choice but to check a couple of bags for the first time and was really concerned from all of the horror stories on here. Ended up not having to wait more than 5 minutes to check my bags at both BOS and DEN despite getting there 2 hours early to get in a long line if needed so it's probably very much an airport/time of day specific issue.

“Once a passenger has been accepted for boarding or has already boarded the flight, airlines are not permitted  to require that passenger deplane, unless the removal of the passenger is required by safety, security, or health reasons, or the removal is due to the passenger’s unlawful behavior.”

Then the following happens:

“Hi FA. This conversation is being recorded. Before I address your request to relinquish my seat for which I have a valid boarding pass that was scanned and accepted at the gate, please tell me: am I presenting a health risk? Am I identified as a security risk? Am I causing any safety concerns? Have you observed any unlawful behavior on my part?

Right, so federal regulations, as shown here, prohibit airlines from removing seated passengers who were permitted to board at the gate. We can wait for law enforcement to arrive, which may affect your on-time departure. They can elect to disregard my rights and I may elect to have my attorney get involved.

so, sorry it happened. Frontier breaks multiple regulations so often with no consequences the staff no longer cares.  

 A DOT complaint and threat of fines may get you some worthless vouchers. You are entitled to a refund, but Frontier sometimes lists passengers as ""no shows"" or even insists they took the flight they were bumped from!

lenm2tv,2024-07-24 11:40:34,"Not the same situation, but I had an issue once where Frontier cancelled a fully booked flight out of Pittsburgh because the plane hit a bird en route to Pittsburgh. Frontier stated, literally, “it was the bird’s fault, so there will be no compensation or accommodations provided.”

When this happened, everyone was in the terminal waiting to board. They forced everyone in the flight to walk all the way back to the ticketing area (before TSA) to be rebooked onto new flights. So, anyone who couldn’t run (like me with a toddler, or elderly passengers) ended up at the end of a massive line and waiting for 2 hours. The call center refused to help anyone, stating the airport staff needed to do the rebooking.

By the time I got in front of an agent, the earliest they could rebook me for was 1 week later. Apparently, if this happens, Frontier will not send another plane to the airport to accommodate the passengers. I heard “it was the bird’s fault, the airline does not make any accommodations when it’s not at fault” from the staff when asking why the airline was not sending another plane next day to take us to our destination.

There were entire families with small children in tears, without the money or means to find a hotel for an entire week, not knowing what to do. People discussing carpooling across the country together (complete strangers). It was nuts.

That was 10 years ago, and I have refused to fly Frontier ever since. I always fly United, even though it costs a little more. Coincidentally, United once has the same situation (inbound plane hit a bird). They provided me and my child with a hotel and meal voucher, and rebooked us for the following morning.

I’m sorry, I’ll never fly Frontier again and risk being stranded in a city for an entire week again.

k4ivv6l,2023-10-12 13:15:51,"So apparently an aircraft swap doesn’t require them to give any compensation. 

That means if you were on the 5am flight where they use the 321N and they downgraded to an A320 it could’ve gone from up to 240 seats, down to 230, 186 or 180. Up to a 60 seat difference, and they’d owe you nothing. 

“Bumped passengers are NOT eligible for compensation in the following situations:

Aircraft Change - A smaller plane is substituted for the larger one the airline originally planned on using due to operational or safety reasons.”

Now looking at flight schedules there was no flight 570 that day. Either 572 5:45 AM or 576 at 12:45 PM. Both seem to have operated normally meaning this exception wouldn’t apply. 

We also must look at the one way fare. You seem to be including round trip plus optional fees. The one way fare for this Friday is $138.68. I assume your one way fare would’ve been far lower. You can check ur original email to find it. 

According to what you’re saying they should’ve given you compensation at the airport. If I booked that flight for a week from Friday it’s $38 base fare. That’s a big difference because then they would only have to offer you $152. 

Be sure not to accept the voucher. It is single use. You need to use the entire $1k in one go. If you do need to accept a voucher in the end push for 10 $100 vouchers. That way you can get 10 trips instead of one with a bunch of left over money.

&gt;I was lucky to be able to book another flight \[stated elsewhere on another airline\] and gtfo, others weren't. 

But how do those reconcile with this one? 

&gt;While waiting \[for my substitute flight on Delta\], I spoke to plenty of folks bumped from the 5am flight who were provided nothing in accommodation nor compensation, just a re-book and 7-8 hours of delay in their travel plans.

Were you or were you not offered a seat on Frontier's next flight? If no, were you just unlucky to be behind others in the rebooking queue who accepted the limited number of vacant seats on the next flight?

**Number bumped / number rebooked**

I'm not seeing how many total passengers were bumped in your post, nor your definition of the ""plenty of folks"" within that group who you spoke with. 

**Your discrimination claim**

&gt;This experience left me with numerous questions unanswered, including why Frontier chose to discriminate against me...  
&gt;  
&gt; ...they did not provide written statement of my rights and they did not explain why only foreigners were bumped

What did they actually say about how the bump selections were made? On what basis did you conclude only foreign nationals were bumped? How do you know that they didn't use a non-discriminatory selection method for the passengers to be bumped, say bumping passengers who didn't check in for the flight until X minutes before boarding?",Htown_Flyer,4,175yd6q,na

You added  \[for my substitute flight on Delta\] but this was while I was on the Frontier flight gate. We were speaking because the departure time was approaching and gate agents just told us to get away.

I was offered to fly in the same flight next day, which didn't work for me honestly as I bought this last minute for an event.

They did not say anything. There were many of us without a seat number from check in so they filled the plane and when gate close time came let 3 of us enter (one of the agents literally picked them with her fingers), then she proceeded to close the door and left us with the remaining agent who bumped the rest of us and gave QR refund business cards. I don't know how they did select who was going to get the remaining seats because they didn't even disclose the flight was overbooked or anything at all, did not ask for volunteers and kept lying until they closed the door.

Frontier lets people get all the way to the gate and announces the cancellation right around boarding time, then makes everyone walk all the way back to the ticketing counter at the front of the airport to get rebooked. Anyone with small children (which was me), a disability, or of advanced age will always end up at the very end of a massive line at the ticketing counter.  They also won’t let you rebook online or by phone if you call while you’re in line. 

In my case, they said that “a bird hit the plane while it was landing, and that was the bird’s fault, so no accommodations will be provided.”

You’re at the hub, and that actually has you being rebooked WAY faster than Frontier typically does. Tampa to Denver, you could have been waiting up to a week, even with layovers.

I was flying in the other direction, so the earliest they were willing to rebook people was the flight 1 week later by the time I got to the counter (after waiting over an hour in the line).

lhtank8,2024-08-13 05:42:07,My flight from Denver to Houston was horrible on Saturday . We boarded the plane at 4:20AM. We sat on a hot plane for like an hour and a half because they said they were waiting on the gate people to steer us out. Another hour passed and an announcement was made that the plane wasn’t working and they were having system issues so we had to wait for maintenance. We sat on the plane for 3 hours before we finally took off. We landed in Houston and sat on the plane for 45 minutes before we were able to get set up at the gate to get off. Never experienced such in my life.,Ok-Understanding-151,1,1eo6009,na

Then they tell us after all that waiting that it's cancled no explanation no concern or remorse for the customers. Then I went and waited in like for about 6 hours to be told I had to go online and deal with their stupid automated bull shit to get a refund and that there where no replacement flights for days and that those flights where about double what I had paid for the canceled ones and that I would have to come up with the money for those on my own because It would take at least a couple weeks for my refund. And since then a complete nightmare dealing with them always some excuse and run around bull shit it's been over 100 days and still no refund. My wife had to drain our savings to rent a car to drive all the way there and pick me up and i got a 500$ speeding ticket on my way home plus picked up a bullshit possession charge in another state that I never should have been in for weed I would never of had if I had just flown home like I was supposed to now I'm facing prison time and have not even began to financially recover and they still won't even give me back my money for the flight that never fucking happened let alone accept any responsibility for the almost 5 grand of bullshit expenses I had to pull out of my ass and don't even get me started on my 500 ticket or the fines or the 3k on a lawyer or the 10k I had to pony up for bail or the night I had to spend in jail or the fact that I literally contemplate blowing my fucking brains out every single day since then ... seriously fuck frontier so hard in every orfice with a red hot blow torch.

lhdu3zk,2024-08-10 11:19:48,"I will never give Frontier my business again. They canceled our flight from DC to Denver literally the night before; we were supposed to arrive by 8:30am this past Saturday. There was no explanation for the cancellation just a “sorry for the inconvenience”. A link was sent to check other flight options for the day, or to request a refund. That was pointless because the link simply took us to a page that showed there were no other flight options through Frontier! So we had to cancel for a refund and then scramble to find a flight with a different airline, at the last minute and paid 3 times the price. Also we ended up arriving at 6pm Saturday on the new flight we booked, effectively losing our entire first day in Denver.

We were able to keep our return back to DC on Frontier and even that didn’t go smoothly. Once at the airport They changed our gate multiple times, having us walk back and forth like idiots. Our flight was delayed because the plane at the gate that was meant to depart before ours “didn’t have a captain”. So our plane couldn’t depart either. There was never even an apology for the inconvenience this time. Just curt and matter of fact attitudes from their staff and little to no real communication on what was happening.

It’s not everybody’s airline, but I view a potential for long layover or one day later flight as a benefit.

I went to the bank “hat in hand” ,apologized profusely.

They told me the machine deposit was never made.  I was dumbfounded.  I had the stub in my hand.  I’d put the check into their machine.

Then it hit me.  They’d once asked if I was John J Doe.  I told them I was John Z Doe.  I said if John J lives on Mulberry road ,then he is my uncle ,and my namesake.  The clerk laughed and said “Yup ,I think you’re right”.

I asked the clerk to see if the exact amount I was missing had been deposited into my uncle’s account on a specific day.  And it was.

Someone ignored everything on that deposit envelope.  They simply entered Doe-John and then put the money into the first account that popped up.

No one checked my bag size. If you want to take a carry on, pay when you book the ticket. I was able to pack a weekender bag from Amazon that was  hugeeee and fit so much stuff and while it was a bit wide at first, I pressed it flat and it slid right in even tho like I said no one checked or stopped me. Both flights I was randomly assigned a window seat so I guess that was just my luck but I volunteered to let the mom next to me stay next to her son and took the isle seat but that was fine as well. I filled my water bottle up in the airport and didn’t have to avoid paying for a drink, but I will say the drinks in the plane are cheaper than in the airport. The flight attendants and pilots were nice and made sure to say when there was gonna be turbulence so that was nice because I hate when the plane starts shaking out of nowhere.

On the day of my flight, at 8:43 AM, I got an text alert from Frontier that my flight has been delayed to 9:43 AM. It was a mixed feeling, i get to spend more time with my family but now I have less time to sleep before work the next day. Then at 12:54 PM they sent me another alert that my flight was changed back to 7:39 PM. I got stressed out, left my family right away without even saying goodbye to my wife and son. I was anxious because I knew at the back of my mind that in between rental car drop off, shuttle and airport security, I will likely miss my flight. I drove at 80 mph through the highway to make up for of the time. I got a speeding ticket because of that ($277 fine). By the time I made it to the gate, it was closed and my plane was moving to the runway.  On my way to the airport, I was chatting with Frontier customer service if there is anyway they can understand my situation but no luck. I explained their rep at the customer service about what happened but they refused to listen. I was told that I have no option but to pay them $99 fee and reschdule.

  
I was routed frokm ATL to DEN (where I had 13 hrs layover) and then DEN to SFO. My manager at work wasn't happy and I missed my wages for a day and got attendance points which affected my review all thanks to great people at Frontier!!!",HSA-HSA,1,16easf9,na

All set for weekend out/back Phila to St Louis (direct) for an engagement party. Frontier cancelled the early am flight 75 min before outbound departure. Closest alternate Frontier flight required an overnight (missing the event). No other airlines showed cancelled flights at that terminal.
Frontier made no effort to help arrange alternate travel with other airlines. Same day flight with any other airline was $300+ 1-way.

They did refund tickets &amp; provided $100 future flight credit. But the family event was missed.

Frontier also didn’t reimburse for travel-related reservations wasted by their cancellation (this time only airport parking, thankfully).

However, another flight attendant insisted that my husband stay in his assigned seat, despite the first attendant's approval. When I questioned her about this inconsistency and the availability of seats, she continued to refuse. I began recording the interaction, which led to her banning me from the flight. Additionally, the flight was delayed for nearly two hours.

The lady at the counter treated me like an idiot when I asked for help. I had looked at my spam inbox and everything it wasn't there. I ended up receiving it 4-5 days after the flight. But the weird thing was you could still buy tickets online and it showed that it was still arriving on time at each of the monitors at the airport itself. I had even been able to check in online. So a quick 2 hr flight was turned into a several hour delay with a several hour layover. I ended up missing out on plans because of it. (Admittedly that was dumb to plan anything immediately after landing, but still 9/10 it would've been fine). Anywho I called and complained and was given a $250 reimbursement. I tried using the voucher today because of a last minute family emergency and they had lied and only given me $100.

I fly out of Denver, so maybe this is part of the problem, but I have to be honest, their boarding process was by far the worst that I have ever experienced.  Both directions, flights were delayed, not by more than an hour, but it was all due to slow, chaotic, frantic boarding processes related to luggage and checking in, confusion (they are so strict on size, it is ridiculous and so many people clog the process with arguments and switching seats, paying for luggage).   The flight itself wasn't bad, other than you literally have to pay for everything.....maybe you can get a glass of water free?   But the boarding on and off from Denver was a mess as well....the Frontier terminal is at the very farthest reaches of DIA which means a lot of time to get to your flight, I saw so many people sprinting full speed to make it in time.   They also struggled with the ramp and when we got off a very full flight, they said that it wasn't working right, so passengers had to step down about a foot from the airplane to get on the ramp.   I was surprised that no one tripped or was injured.  The lady next to me kept asking, is this for real?  It was, well, in my opinion pretty ridiculous, some basic processes that seem like they could easily be streamlined without a lot of investment??   I actually felt pretty bad for the staff, they honestly appeared to be pretty over it as well.  Kind of sad, I will probably only fly Frontier again as a last resort.

jzx4x1r,2023-09-10 13:41:10,"Typically I fly frontier for shorter flights SAN-LAS. If you can get by not buying any addons and make sure your personal item meets the dimensions you have a very cheap flight. The seats are narrow, the leg room is tight. Worst I've experienced is a 1-2hr delay.

All Airlines have horror stories. Some more than others. Plan for delays and you might be surprised at how nice the planes are and how cheap the fare is. When you really get down to it, a ton of complaints are due to people trying to get by the free personal item size and getting forced to pay $100 or cancellations/delays (which happen to every airline).

The key to reducing the likely hood of a delay is to get on the earliest flight of the day. These airlines (Spirit/Frontier) operate a route with one plane. As the day goes on, delays tend to get longer and longer. If there's an issue with the plane there's usually no back up plane, so you end up getting delayed until its worked out or the flight is canceled.

Before booking, look up the flight on flightaware you can see the history of the flight and what to general expect if it's delayed. For me my typical route on frontier from SAN to LAS flight has an average delay of 10 minutes in the morning. I can deal with the delays for $37 round trip.",May1ene,1,16easf9,na

Completely numb to the fact that for a lot of people, the stress and financial consequences from missing a flight can reverberate for months. I had four attendants watch with arms crossed after asking me to put my two year olds shoes on while boarding. I was carrying him on my hip and my one year old in a carrier. It was a physical struggle to get it done and not drop or injure any of us in the process😆. They all gaped. I was almost in tears because I bonked the baby’s head. Two year old got all frazzled. Simple politeness and at least a word of support would be helpful if they can’t actually lend a hand. For example, instead of saying “if you don’t put his shoes on you’re not getting on this flight”. They could’ve simply said “I’m so sorry I know you’ve got your hands full, but he doesn’t need to wear his shoes. Can I help you set your bag down when you try to get a shoe on”. I’ve had so many experiences like this. Traveling when I just had one that was eight weeks old and I struggled to get my bag in to the overhead bin. It was hard for me to get it up because I had the baby in the carrier and was still recovering from a C-section. (it takes so long to get your ab strength back.) The flight attendant chastised me saying that if I couldn’t fit the bag in there, then I couldn’t bring it on the flight. I got so stressed. The bag was not big at all there is plenty of space but again it almost ended in tears because they all still there staring at me and  none could lift a finger to help. Last time I traveled again with both kids ages, one and two, a whole heap of bags. After waiting in the bag, check line for an hour and a half they selected us and a passenger in a wheelchair to do an additional security screening on our bags which means we have to drag the box halfway across the airport and then run back to the desk for them to scan and take the bag. They said it was random that they just had to pick two people from the line and they picked us and an elderly man in a wheelchair. It made us so late.

kdvy3zf,2023-12-18 21:13:58,"Yes, Frontier is a horror show, but not for what you think.  It’s not the no-frills, lucky not to pay for air on the flight stuff that is expected in budget carriers.  It’s not even the delays.  It’s Frontier’s shamefully underhanded manner of handling operations when things go wrong.  

1. Frontier is the ONLY airline that will not pay for any overnight accommodation for significant delays.

2. Frontier’s sole DOT commitment to passengers is to provide meal compensation for significant delays. 

Frontier fulfills its commitment to its “guests who are very important” to them via a $5 “meal” voucher, which, if pooled along with other passengers vouchers might be enough for you all to buy a single Tic Tac you can share.

3.  That voucher?  It isn’t really a voucher at all.  It’s a $5 reimbursement you’ll receive on your card days later.  Oh, and Frontier only lets you enjoy that largesse at “qualifying” vendors.  If you can find a list of those vendors anywhere, I’ll happily eat the voucher currently sitting in my inbox.

4. While other airlines will issue some sort of refund or travel credit for delays over 3 hours, Frontier is one of the few that gives be you precisely sweet FA.  Nothing.  Nada. Zip.  And because the DOT has only put together a “voluntary” commitment to passengers for airlines to follow, Frontier are completely free to deliver the exactly nothing they’ve committed to doing for the passengers that are so important to them.

4. Frontier will repeatedly delay a flight instead of cancelling it because once cancellation kicks in, they actually are required to compensate something beyond that amazing than a four star single Tic Tac meal.

5. Frontier’s favorite delay is “flight crew regulation” delays.  Flight crew issues are not force majeure (acts of God), they are completely within the carrier’s control. Remember that as you and your fellow passengers descend into Lord of the Flies type madness fighting over who gets that last bit of that Tic Tac meal Frontier so generously compensated you with—you, the passenger who is so important to them.

It’s precisely all of the above seedy, underhanded nonsense that Frontier engages in that earns them their spot at the best of the worst airline carriers in the States.",Humble_Command_723,1,16easf9,na
ke6mad9,2023-12-20 22:35:33,"Yes, it is.  1) It is basic like Spirit but a whole other level of bad customer service. I always hated flying Spirit but now Spirit seems quite professional and enjoyable in comparison. 2) The Personal Item Rule. If you are a good, literal rule-follower, then it might not bug you as much. I tend towards wanting rules to have meaning and for me to understand them so I find their personal item rule endlessly frustrating (I know, I could just COMPLY and make it easier on myself.). A logical form of the personal item rule would be to require that the item fit underneath the seat in front of you. But, no, that is not the Frontier rule: the size of the personal item is smaller than what will fit underneath the seat in front of you. Presumably this is so they can make more money charging people for carry-on luggage. Lots of people, like me,  try to push the edges of this rule (as it is illogical and also if you are flying frontier you are probably trying to save money). Most airlines would turn a blind eye so long as the personal item is not really a roll away bag that obviously must be stored above. But not Frontier. I have had numerous flights where they stand there and make everyone try to shove their personal item into their ridiculously sized box. Then, to add to the absurdity, if you take items out of your bag, like a laptop, so that the bag will now fit into their box and carry the removed items in your hand, they let you go by. If you are the kind of person who doesn't get annoyed by that kind of thing, then go for it. I am the opposite kind of person, so I always make the experience more stressful for myself. 2) I flew through Guatemala City on Frontier on the way back from Costa Rica. I booked the legs separately through Kiwi to save money, so I arrived in Guatemala City without a boarding pass for the outbound flight and having to check-in still. Frontier evidently doesn't pay the airport fees in that airport (I don't really know why the experience was so crazy, but that is my guess) so my flight never appeared on the Departure list of the airport - not on the airports website or the in-airport screens. So there I am sitting in the outer room of the GC airport from 6 pm until 10 pm, solo female traveler, waiting for someone to show up at the Frontier ticket counter to confirm if this flight is actually real. Then the frontier people arrived at the ticket counter, checked us all in, told us the gate, etc. But then the flight never showed up on the gate screen either and was several hours late taking off without explanation. So that was a tad bit stressful again. Then evidently Frontier doesn't pay to use the normal airport speakers either so the Frontier people had to bring a portable speaker with a mic that happened to have a light show as one of its features, lol. And would compete with the announcements of airlines who actually pay to use the airport services. It was absurd. We finally did take off at like 2 in the morning and I made it safely back to the US. So that is something, lol. But I am trying to let the experience finally convince me to not get lured in by the cheap fares. The added stress is not worth it.",Plastic-Chemical-638,1,16easf9,na
ke8mdo7,2023-12-21 05:55:09,"Frontier makes me realize that America really is going downhill.  I now call it Pakistani Air.  If you book a flight more than 1 day in advance, IT WILL BE UNILATERALLY CHANGED, often for a later day (sometimes 2 or more).  Yes, the US Dept of Transportation requires them to give you a full refund if the change is not acceptable and is for more than 3 hours, but Frontier will not give you a telephone number to request that refund (Expedia provides you a telephone number but Frontier has shut that number down ... and apparently not notified Expedia).  If you use their required chat, pour a good drink, you'll be online for 1 to 2 hours.  My last refund got me 275 people in front of me in their chat line.  Then after everything is said and done, they will simply direct you to a hidden website and the chat won't even allow you to ""click through"" to it.  You'll have to copy it and go to it, fill out a form that will require you to provide all  of your flight information, numerous pieces of personal information and then be informed that it has been sent to them for evaluation and that you should expect to hear from them after 7 days.  (They've already had the float on my fraudulent obtained funds for months).  Interestingly, I had a pilot friend who flew for them.  After he moved to a ""real"" airline he told me that all the pilots with Frontier are trying to get jobs elsewhere and only remain until they can leave to a better airline.  Next, check out the US Dept of Transportation website.  Frontier has BY FAR the most complaint and most bumped passengers of any airline.

Maybe it’s bad on other airlines too but the frontier customer base is horrible and annoying with how much it happens.

I always fly stretch seating in the emergency row and every flight people try to sneak into these seats. 

I always turn the other way because it’s not my job or problem but I was sitting on the aisle with the middle seat empty between me and the window passenger in the emergency row. Right before take off, like as the pilot says, “Flight attendants prepare for take off” some guy two rows back literally jumps into the middle seat in the process kicking one of my legs and stepping on my toes on the other foot. I was startled because he didn’t even say anything or give me a heads up to move out of the way. It hurt too because he was a heavy guy and I was kinda trapped with him kicking one leg but trapping me because he was standing on my other foot.

It was pretty quiet too because it was midnight at this point and I made a scene. If the guy hadn’t kicked me hard AND stepped on my toes I would have been much cooler. He was also a bigger guy so he was in my space while sitting and had a blanket with him that was on both me and the window passenger.

I was loud saying WTF and what are you doing!?! He didn’t apologize or anything and just said that he needed to sit here because his row was too cramped. I kept loudly telling him to go back to his seat but he refused to leave. We were taking off so I waited to get in air to ring over the flight attendants.

After we reached proper elevation, the flight attendants came over and he begged to stay in the seat and they were about to let him because they don’t care but I decided to be an asshole because he literally stepped on me during his last minute seat hopping and said if he stays in the seat, I need a police offer to meet us at the gate because he assaulted me and I want to press charges.

The flight attendants asked if I was serious and I say yes. The lady in the aisle seat across from me spoke up and said she witnessed everything and can back me up with the police report. I then asked for the names of the flight attendants because I said I will be pursuing it with Frontier as well and they moved him back to his seat.

I wasn’t gonna spend the next 4 hours trying to sleep next to someone like this guy because I didn’t trust him. He clearly didn’t give a damn about anyone but himself and if he knew there were gonna be cops waiting for him when we land, I wasn’t closing my eyes around him.",droplivefred,17,16g1eud,na

k05mvd7,2023-09-12 03:56:07,"I got to see the Frontier FA,s deal with a wanna-be seat switcher recently.

Chapter 1
I was in row 3 and the lady was in a seat just behind me.

During boarding, she saw that not every seat in the first 3 rows was occupied. Apparently she asked FA 1 standing at an aisle seat and greeting passengers if she could move up and was told no. I didn,t hear the first part of that exchange, but became focused on what was going on as she persisted through playing dumb, claiming some reason she was deserving of a favor, etc, etc. Like a game of 20 questions. It was all BS, of course. Virtually no one gets to row 4 without paying and seeing that it costs more or less on Frontier flight depending on which row you select.

It never got loud or testy, but it went on for a while. The FA finally summarized the conversation, said her decision was final and went up to the galley area to prepare for the door closing sequence. I give the FA an A for putting up with Ms. Entitled for as long as she did.

FA 2 was chatting with a friendly passenger in row 1 during this sequence, but I could see he was observing.

Chapter 2
A gate agent came through the door and began a conversation with FA 1. I also missed the start of that, but Ms. Entitled spoke right up to alert all of us in the first 6 rows or so that FA 1 was allegedly talking mean about her and telling lies to the gate agent. FA 1 gets an A grade once again...she just turned her back to the racket and goes on about her business with the gate agent.

Again, FA 2 is quietly observing...

Chapter 3
Ms. Entitled loudly plays the victim long enough to essentially recounts her the entire prior conversation and BS stories with an ""I was just asking"" explanation for 20 of us who couldn't care less.

Enter FA 2. He starts a conversation with ""ma'am, I need you to lower your voice"" and has his game face on. 

I won,t try to dramatize it, but it eventually took three ""Do you have an attitude? Because if this continues, we won,t be able to take you to (destination city)"" to get Ms. Entitled to STFU.

FA gets an A, too.",Htown_Flyer,2,16g1eud,na

lk0059g,2024-08-26 11:55:03,"There are a thousand things going on in the background with an airline.  It's possible the crew worked a previous flight, and when the maintenance delay occurred the crew didn't have enough time to legally fly the plane.  Then they couldn't find another crew.  Happens all the time.  This is just one example of many moving parts. 

What's not acceptable is the lack of communication and support.  Additionally, with that kind of delay, I believe you're due hotel and food vouchers, or a cancellation and refund (which doesn't really help with getting to your destination, but it is what it is).

Frontier definitely doesn't have the best reputation, and your experience seems to validate that.",BeeDubba,4,1f1chcu,ljyovhr

The total price, for both of us round-trip, was less than $120. Both flights shut the door a minute or two before departure time and arrived early. The only hiccup was on our return flight when we had to wait on the tarmac for a gate to clear. The wait was a little more than 45 minutes, but I don’t know how much of that was on Frontier, another airline, or the airport. We have “Frontier personal item“ bags from Amazon and the agent in Salt Lake didn’t even make us put our bags in the sizer. The guy in front of us with a huge backpack and two large carry-ons, claiming that he had already paid the required fees but  not having a boarding pass for the right group, didn’t have as much luck. Finally, Frontier didn’t seat us together, I assume because we didn’t pay for seats, but we ended up sitting together in a row by ourselves both times because the flights were only about 75% full.

kxqxto9,2024-04-03 03:59:02,"Based on the layout and checking SeatGuru, it looks like the cheap exit row seats have more leg room, but do not have available floor storage under the seat in front of them (probably a barrier).  I have never flown Frontier, but from what I read about them, that probably means they will charge you for any bag you bring on the plane since it will now be a carryon instead of a personal item that can go under the seat.  Or maybe as long as it is personal item size you won't be charged, but what I have read indicates that if they can find a way to charge you, they will.

Edit: I have spent way too much searching on this for some reason.  It sounds like you won't be charged, but without the underseat storage you bag will end up in an overhead bin back several rows, so access is not as easy.  Your choice.",CogentCogitations,8,1bu4nhy,na

ky2y6aw,2024-04-05 06:02:14,"Always cheaper at the airport to buy tickets. My home airport is Las Vegas, where you wait in line where people check bags prior to security, so that’s from my experience. If you buy it 2 weeks+ before your flight, it’s much cheaper but I think after it, the difference isn’t that extreme.

Most of my round trips are under $100 say if I go to Chicago (my most frequent destination). I think for Orlando I had a ~150ish round trip. Most times the taxes are more than the actual ticket fare. Spirit does the same, Allegiant is more restrictive. All the other major airlines that aren’t “budget” have no benefit of buying at the airport versus online.

Edit: Frontier/Spirit don’t prioritize people who are checking bags because mostly there’s a lot of agents at LAS. I don’t even think it’s a separate line. I typically go at around 10-11pm when the last night flights are taking off. If this something you’re planning on doing frequently, it’s going to be trial &amp; error depending on your airport on hours that they are there.

The whole premise of the ultra low cost airlines is that they can get you to where you need to go at a super cheap price if you don't want to bring luggage, don't care where you sit, and don't want any on-board amenities like food.

I use Frontier a lot for short flights from Denver and it works great as long as you know what you are buying.

Yet every couple of days we see posts from people who buy a ticket *without* paying for any add-ons like a seat assignment, say the somehow this is a scam.

And then anyone who points out that the consumer doesn't/didn't understand how Frontier operates is a corporate ""simp"" even though the issue is laziness on the part of the consumer.

ks9yf5f,2024-02-27 05:11:10,"In the future, **document everything.**

If you have documentation (pictures with time stamps or videos) showing that you were in line 2 hours prior to departure, that the airline had excessive lines compared to all other competitor airlines, that the kiosk failed, that the agent told you to go to the back of the line, etc, then a chargeback would work.

As it stands, it sounds like you have zero documentation to support this.

Evidence to support this: I had a Frontier agent tell me my checked bag was 2 lb over their weight limit while trying to check it. Checked bag line was 1-1.5 hrs long (pretty normal for them).

They told me to go to the back of the line or pay the overage. I started filming (discretely) - as a just in case - I pulled the bag off the scale, pulled a pair of shoes and a jacket out, and stuck it back on the scale. This took about 20 seconds.

While I was doing it, the agent was literally yelling at me (at the top of her lungs - whole airport was staring) to stop what I was doing and go to the back of the line. Once I placed the bag back on the scale and picked my phone back up to show that I was filming. I don't think I said anything during this entire 20 second interaction.

The agent said I was no longer allowed to fly as I had failed to follow her requests. I reiterated that I had broken no rules and was prepared to fly.

Cops came over. Made a report. That report consisted of ""passenger removed pair of shoes and jacket from their bag."" No arrest - no trespass. Again, I never yelled and remained calm the entire time. I asked for a Frontier supervisor. There was not one available (convenient for them). I wasn't allowed to fly. I got the entire interaction on video - and everything was in the police report.

I walked over to the American desk and paid for the next flight. (Frontier flight was around $125 - American flight was around $650)

When I got home, I filed a chargeback against Frontier - and sent a demand letter for $5,000 (American flight plus mental anguish). Two phone calls and about a dozen emails later (including one with a link to the videos), I received a refund for the $125 flight and a check for $750 from Frontier.

The point? Document everything. When they mess up (which they will), you will be in the clear.

Edited to add: I was prepared to sue them. What they did was wrong. I made it very clear in my phone calls and emails with them that I would file suit if they didn't pay up. And that this lawsuit was going to cost them far more than what I was asking for.",Zealousideal_Cover29,1,1azz3gz,na

ksaf7to,2024-02-27 06:44:12,"Had a similar situation happen on a trip back home from Cancun. 2 agents to check in 5 flights to 5 major cities all with 120+ people on each flight. I was there 3.5 hours early and ended up in line for 6 hours and waiting in the terminal for an additional 2.5 hours. The flights all were held for longer because of how many people were in line.
Needless to say, during that time, I pulled up their terms of carriage. I can’t remember now if it was at 5 hours or 8 hours of delay, but if your flight lands later than that number they owe you at minimum a refund for that flight for the full amount- this is per THEIR terms. We landed 30 minutes after that number and I talked to the gate agent immediately after getting off the flight. She had no idea and neither did her manager, so great training. They wouldn’t help me past that and told me to leave. I ended up filing a complaint with DOT who then made them pay 4x the amount of that leg of the flight which was just over $800.

I got really lucky though. My connecting flight was with Delta and I missed it because of that. But apparently that flight something was wrong with the plane (de-icing I’m guessing- January in MN) so that flight was delayed an hour. Delta apparently has some sort of policy that if the flight is delayed more than an hour you can choose to rebook for a different flight.  It apparently didn’t matter that the flight had already left and landed, so I rebooked for the next morning and used some Hilton points to crash for 6 hours before I had to be back.",jesslarson09,1,1azz3gz,na

Frontier charges a $25 fee for this, but it saved me when I arrived at the airport 40 mins prior to departure and they wouldn't let me check it at the desk.

Also, if the kiosk isn't working and you don't want to go back to take the picture, see if offering to pay for agent assistance to check you in helps. Agent assistance is a paid add-on service that lets you use the help desk to check in.

Definitely a shitty situation to be in to pay for Frontier's incompetence, but it's better than missing the flight. Whenever I take cruises, I never fly Frontier or Spirit because it's important to have a reliable airline.

Frontier is terrible about refunds. Once they left me stranded in Denver on a flight from DCA to SFO (cancellation, weather) and refused to refund the DCA-DEN portion of the trip because I already used it.

kymwurd,2024-04-09 00:10:44,"I'm not a road warrior but traveled regularly for many years for work, and unfortunately the airline industry has IMO deservedly caused most of the mistrust passengers have. You have the extremes like ValueJet (if you really want to go down this rabbithole I recommend Flying Blind Fly Save by Mary Schiavo, but don't read it unless you are a confident flyer) but more recently, with Boeing you are seeing a top tier manufacturer exposed for serious quality control / design issues. 

Though everyone wants safety first, this should be automatic and not the situation OP related which is that an engine issue was already known, the plane took off, sort of tested the engine, and had an emergency landing situation. Probably better if the airline spent the extra time to thoroughly diagnose the engine issues and elect to not fly the plane at all IMO. 

Also - I'm aware of the headaches and expenses an airline and passengers might suffer if the airline just outright cancels the flight. But if the airlines had a better system for dealing with these situations - including being able/willing to book passengers on other airlines - people would probably not feel like a flight cancellation is such a problem - which it absolutely is given todays circumstances,",schmitty23,2,1bxw2a0,na

They played it off as a minor inconvenience and got us on the runway.   I fly 3-4 trips a year but never on frontier.

The above person said they had to wait for a gate checked stroller, and while waiting overheard the conversation between the pilot and the fire commander. They heard the pilot say one engine was struggling on takeoff and not working, so he kept the plane low and returned to the airport. The pilot said that on the return the OTHER engine went out, giving him zero working engines.

Last year, we had to change a returning flight from Jacksonville to Dallas from SW to AA. Disaster. They had us put our carrier on a table and several people were coming over and moving the carrier around to decide if it was too small for our dog. While trying to decide if our dog was comfortable, they put him in an overwhelming situation. By the end of this ""screening"" he was shaking and terrified. They were ill-equipped to handle an animal and then determined I was a bad parent for putting my dog in ""such a small space.""

kxiu3ye,2024-04-01 18:04:22,"Do you really think the baggage handlers in Vegas or Denver purposely (your word, “maliciously”) broke your stroller? Don’t you think it’s possible that it was damaged \*accidentally* &amp; inadvertently by shifting cargo? 

It’s not fun by any stretch, but it happens. You just go to the baggage claim area and report the damage. They will either direct you to have it repaired and be reimbursed… or they may give you a list of places you can go where there would be no upfront cost to you. Either way, federal law requires them to compensate you or repair it. You don’t just have to mutter under your breath, and write it off as ruined. 😏

As far as telling you to run while carrying your child… what would have rather they done? 

“Sir, if you would please be so kind as to casually stroll into the airport, &amp; we will bring your stroller to you in just a moment, once we are sure the plane will be stable and not rip off the jetway. Thank You”     
OR      
“Sir, please keep moving. Get off of the jetway immediately. Run!” (So that if the plane did tip and pull the jetway away from the building, you wouldn’t still be waiting, oblivious to the peril you may have been in.)

Obviously, they were afraid of an imminent danger as the passengers were disembarking.  You may have thought the possibility of the plane tipping was ludicrous statement. Surely, it must have sounded like someone was making it up— an asinine joke. Once you realized the jetway was becoming unstable, why did anyone have to tell you to hold your child tighter and run to safety? 🤷‍♀️ 

I personally think telling you to run was the prudent thing to do. 

I am by no means a Frontier fan. Personally, I’ll choose a Delta flight over any other, if one is available. 

But sometimes cargo shifts, sometimes things break, sometimes passengers, even off duty pilots, get stupidly drunk and have to be handled by security. And when there’s the possibility that a dangerous situation is about to unfold, sometimes you may be told to run whilst carrying your child.

Speaking of effort, the stupid process of writing them to get made whole will take effort. It wastes all of our time. Those time costs are costs they are making us incur.

As far as the damaged stroller, apparently, that is up to each airline. The DOT regulations can be found here:
https://www.transportation.gov/lost-delayed-or-damaged-baggage#maximum%20limits%20on%20liabilities. 
While it SOUNDS like strollers would be covered, it appears that the airlines are using one paragraph in this language to exclude strollers under the ""fragile"" provision. This article goes over the policies of multiple air carriers:https://annaeverywhere.com/airline-broken-stroller/. 
It really all sums up to, ""Suck it."" It's pretty ridiculous. However, you probably aren't going to get any money back. It sucks. Airlines can't even be trusted to handle wheelchairs. They're not going to handle strollers. I would go with a folded umbrella stroller even if the baby is too young for it just to hold the car seat and your stuff and hold the baby in sling.

I understand pilots don’t want to be treated like they’re drunks, I’m sure the vast majority aren’t, but would it be so bad to just breathalyzer them before every flight? We put car locks with breathalyzers required for every time someone with a DUI drives. Not in all cases but it’s something we *can* and do do sometimes. 

Maybe they’d really rebel against that but I can’t help but think it wouldn’t be that hard logistically. And the good pilots might be reassured knowing they’re no longer going to have to deal with a drunk copilot.

File a suit in small claims court. Did you suffer a physical reaction? Sue for emotional distress.

I'm not a lawyer, so perhaps you should post in r/legal.  I really only advocate suing in two instances: It can be done in small claims, and it doesn't lack merit.

Frontier isn't exactly the most respected airline. Search through this sub and you'll find tons of negative stories. Hard to believe all those issues were just caused by people's attitudes and nothing to do with the airline.

Unfortunately Denver has the baggage police at the gate who literally make every person carrying a bag pack to measure it.  They are not rude…not mean…they are doing the job they were told to do.  They charge those whose bags are oversized and let the others thru.  One evening we were delayed 30 minutes due to so many people trying to get thru with oversized backpacks. Never a late flight…nor a rude employee.   Just average people doing the job they get paid to do.

I was shocked because I had flown back and forth from Minnesota to Utah 6-8 times a year, usually stopping in DIA, and using frontier 80% of the time and had had no issue. Granted this was all in 2016-2020. Had never had to measure my bag before. So my fiancée and I, plus a few other people were on the side pulling clothes out of our bags and putting them on so our bags would fit.

My flight was delayed nearly 8 hours this Monday out of DEN. Which is CRAZY. After the initial delay, I then got a second delay for a total of 10 hours, now with an overnight layover in a different state, not arriving home until 2PM the following day. HOW is that okay???

No passenger should ever have to endure such treatment or feel disrespected by airline employees. Your feedback highlights serious concerns about customer service and professionalism within Frontier Airlines.



While it's unfortunate that you had such a negative experience, your decision to share your story can help others make informed choices about their travel options. It's important for airlines to understand the impact of their actions on their customers and strive to improve their services accordingly.



If you haven't already, consider reaching out to Frontier Airlines to formally lodge a complaint about your experience. Providing detailed feedback about the specific incidents you encountered may help the airline address these issues and prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.



In the meantime, I hope your next travel experience is much smoother and more enjoyable.",Beginning-Pitch-8225,1,1c4xvx6,na

Frontier is the reason why so many people can now afford to take families of 4, 5, or 6 to Disney, and money saved on tickets is used on better accommodation. They are the reason why other, larger airlines keep their fares low.

You spend years flying with the company and figuring out what combinations of add-ons are worth it, then they keep changing the rules. In this case it feels like retribution for not paying for seats—the change doesn’t obviously save them money, it just makes the experience worse for customers. 

Of course if you are willing to fly discounted standby, you take what you can get in an even more extreme way.

What these scumbags at Frontier do however is just cancel your flight and after you complain they refund your money. Sometimes they lie and say they will refund your money and then never do. Then you get screwed having to pay way more money for a flight with no notice. This happened to my family and I trying to return to DTW from MIA. And no the travel credit cards don't cover this for trip cancelation; except weather. 

When you file a trip cancelation claim you have to show proof they canceled your flight, refunded your money and could not get you an alternative flight the same or next day. The process can take weeks to get reimbursed for your now significantly more expensive replacement flight.

However, they charge 50 to 100% more than the big 3 for checking a bag, and the cost to them has to be fairly minimal, so something that should absolutely be a big revenue driver as people actively avoiding it.

la5c0rc,2024-06-25 10:24:48,"Here’s the problem with posts like this. What OP considers walking up right as they called final call might be that in his head but from the gate agent’s side of the story, they might have done final call and looked up and didn’t see anyone in line and started processing the standby passengers to get the already delayed plane boarded and up in the air quickly.

After they make the announcement, OP might have looked up. Wrapped up whatever they were reading/doing on their phone. Searched for and pulled up their boarding pass. Then stood up, collected their bags and started walking to the door. Maybe they were sitting several rows away from the door so it took some time to navigate to the door. All that time, the gate agent didn’t see anyone else in line so they cleared the unboarded passengers and started reassigning their seats to the standby passengers.

I find people tend to walk slowly and without purpose at the airport way too much so it’s possible OP is like this so by the time they actually were ready to scan their pass, boarding was already closed.

I find people who play games and operate by their own rules often find out that their own rules aren’t universal.",droplivefred,12,1dnn7pk,na

There was a medical emergency on the flight and Frontier was forced to divert to save passenger’s life.

Under no circumstances, Frontier intended to cancel the flight.

OP was offered to be rebooked next available flight but not sure what happened, they either chose not to, or did and never showed up on that flight.

Due to uncontrollable cancelation Frontier has no obligation to reimburse the passengers as per DOT rules. However, should have offered the refund which is not clear why was not offered.

I’ve sat in row 2 and here is how I deal with this issue. I always sit in the aisle so I get up quickly when we land and try to get to that overhead bin behind me before rows 3 and 4 stand up. 

Or I ask row 3 or 4 to pass my bag to me if they get up first and block the aisle already.

Third option is to put your bag in the bin 2 rows behind you and then after everyone has boarded and stowed their carry ons in the overhead bins, I check if the front bins still have empty space and move my bag forward. As this point it is okay and allowed in my experience.

My last resort/recommendation is to choose row 3 instead of 2 since it is still the premium seating and then you are closer to your bag and can either still get it yourself or ask just one person to pass it to you.

kczir8l,2023-12-12 10:45:32,"First thing I always point out to people is that the overhead bins don’t belong to a certain row. One bin runs the length of about two rows. That means if all 6 people in those two rows had a carryon bag, only 4-5 would fit. 

In the case of the Frontier overhead bins, that first bin is not even a full bin. The front half has emergency equipment, so the actual free space doesn’t even start until row 2. If the thought process is that the bin above your row belongs to just your row, that would mean row 1 would not have any overhead bin space or under seat stowage. Since row 1 does not have under seat stowage and all items (including purses) must be stowed, most FAs will reserve that first bin for row 1. Good luck trying to get a woman to stow her purse several rows back. I wouldn’t want my money, IDs, or medication that far from me, so I don’t blame them.

When someone gives me a hard time about stowing in row 3 or beyond, I always explain the situation and tell them I will gladly move their stuff forward if space is available after all of the row 1 passengers have boarded. Some still act crappy. Some understand. 

And for the record, the bins in the aft cabin are even worse. The last 3 bins have a life raft and emergency equipment. All those passengers must find overhead bin space before they reach their row.

kinhfon,2024-01-20 00:23:04,"So I'll explain where the hate comes from. I used to be like you, I flew Frontier all the time and loved them. I would just take a backpack for a personal item and it would sit under my seat just fine. They were a cool, cheap airline.

The thing about Frontier is when everything goes to plan they are a solid airline. But when shit hits the fan, it hits it hard. I found this out the hard way.

1. Frontier cancelled my outgoing flight early in the morning of, several hours before the flight so presumably not weather-related. I didn't get an email right away, instead I got a google notification about it.
2. At the time Frontier had phone support but it wasn't 24 hours, they only operated it during business hours and were in a different timezone so they opened later. I had to utilize their automated chat service which was not helpful at all in coordinating a new flight. Now they no longer even have phone service, just whatsapp and email.
3. I ended up buying a different outgoing flight day of and eating the cost. When I flew Frontier back, they had gate agents scrutinizing everyone's personal items including my backpack. I had literally flown dozens of Frontier flights with the same backpack under the seat no problem. This time they had me try to squeeze it into a device at the gate which was smaller than any under seat space I've seen. It didn't and I was forced to pay a $100 fee for carryon privileges. Of course when I got on the flight I slid it under my seat no problem. Turns out they receive a commission for assigning gate fees, and there are horror stories on here about people forced to pay even without a device available to measure their item.
4. I tried to contact support for a refund on the $100. I both called and emailed. I was polite and patient but they were stubborn and refused to help. On other airlines I am fairly confident I could have at least received a partial voucher for my troubles. Nothing with Frontier. They did end up offering to refund the outgoing leg, which is great but why didn't they do that automatically when it was cancelled and they didn't rebook me? Not great.
5. That was the last time I've flown Frontier. I've tried to give them another shot but their bag prices skyrocketed, previously $30 one way to now $58+. So $120 round trip for a single carryon, which I have to do since I can't trust my personal item making it through anymore. They also started adding ridiculous fees like $23 to buy tickets online on their website (as opposed to at the airport), and $5 to print your boarding pass at home (instead of using the app). I can still save $25-50 flying with them vs another airline, but if something goes awry then I have to hassle with texting to sort my issues. Not a fan.

So there you have it, and that's honestly one of the tamer horror stories with Frontier on here. Many people have had it way worse. No airline is perfect but the major carriers at least give somewhat of a fuck about you whereas Frontier is too busy penny pinching. But like I said, they are great when everything goes well. They just suck bad when things go wrong.",billdb,1,19aetma,kilu0r5

Everyone is expected to show up and check your bags in the specified window of time.  Once that window closes no matter what they are shutting the desk down. Those same 2 employees are going to be the ones that let you onto the plane at the gate. And they arent going to hold up a plane for you.  They get fines if they don't depart on time.  

They literally cut their staff in half compared to other airlines and over multiples around the country that alone is a big cost savings. So you get what you pay for.  I'm good with it.  Love the cheap fares.",Independent-Bet5465,5,19aetma,na
kimz15b,2024-01-20 02:43:40,"&gt;Those same 2 employees are going to be the ones that let you onto the plane at the gate.

This makes sense for cost savings, but if they open up 2 hours before the flight and can't process all the people waiting in time, that's the airlines problem. People paid for a service and if its impossible to get that service, then they are offering something they can't fulfill.

Imagine the extreme case: Frontier could overbook 1000 cheap tickets to the flight, and then oops we can only process 200 people in the line from the time the desk opens till it closes, The other 800 people get turned away and Frontier keeps the money. Makes absolutely no sense.

As mentioned in another comment, if they expect a big line, the bag tagging machines should be open earlier so that people can prepare bags so they can just bag drop, perhaps paying a staff member 30 minutes or 1 hour extra time before they open the desk.

Maybe instead of having individual airlines be responsible for the automated bag tagging machines, the airport could have a shared set of machines open all the time that can tag bags for any company so that people can arrive as early as they want, then when the desk opens, one line can be for pre-tagged bag drop only and the other can be ""needs assistance"", until everyone has dropped the pre-tag bags off.",kwbloedo,5,19aetma,kimjjbi

I figured, it's an hour before the flight, that's fine. At 30min prior to flight time I walked over to check it was the right gate on the monitors.  At 20min prior to flight time, an agent strolled out of the jetbridge (where she must have been hiding?) and declared the flight had left and I'd need to catch the next one.  

I guess the jetbridge had been open and they expected I would walk down it myself?  Anyway, the next flight had engine trouble and was delayed over 5 hrs while mechanics fixed it, by then I had given up and missed that flight, too.

lgwg65a,2024-08-07 14:38:55,"Hi, I'm a Frontier crew member. Posting from a throwaway account, and writing from my own POV, not the company's, so I'm not claiming any official representation here. I'm just writing to share some empathy and provide some perspective. I hope it helps.

Human trafficking has become a major issue, with horrifying consequences. But as another commenter pointed out, it can be very hard to spot. It's not usually obvious, because the people who kidnap humans are not stupid. They know if they were to march a drugged person through an airport or bus station, or someone fighting and screaming, they'd quickly be identified.

So instead, we are trained to look for more subtle signs. In the interests of not providing information in a public forum which could help traffickers, I'll just say they vary. Some are behavioral, some are physical, some are verbal. Without knowing you or your daughter personally, I don't know what specifically caught someone's attention. But understand that none of these are ""guaranteed"" signs of trafficking. It's not like seeing a guy in a ski mask dragging a bag of money away from a bank robbery. Think of them more as suggestions, or indicators. The odds are greater than trafficking is taking place when some of those signs are present.

For whatever unfortunate reason, someone thought they viewed those signs around your daughter. Again, I wasn't there, so I don't know what they were. Perhaps she looked uncomfortable from all of the unpleasant things about air travel. Perhaps there was a cultural difference that the observing employee didn't understand. Perhaps they don't have much experience around trans people and misinterpreted something innocent or normal to you.

I believe your story and am deeply sorry that you had to experience it. I truly am. The police officer's comment was completely inappropriate. But if you're willing to examine things from a third party perspective for a moment, please consider that the employee who made the report did so with the intent of protecting your child. The aircraft is really the last opportunity to stop the human trafficking process, and the consequences of missing someone are unspeakably bad. A lifetime of sexual or physical slavery is a common end. Imagine the horror of losing a child to that because someone who thought they saw a suspicious sign decided to not speak up.

To put it another way. In an actual human trafficking situation, with a nine year old girl kidnapped and flown on an aircraft, what would handling it look like? Step back and consider the scenario carefully. While there were some clear missteps here, what you described is more or less how things are handled. The potential victim must be spoken with by a professional out of earshot of the potential kidnapper. Their identities need to be verified. And it must be done before they disappear into the crowd, never to be seen again. It's a sad reality in a world where such cruelty exists.

Could things have been handled better? Yes. Did you go through a traumatic, frustrating, and humiliating experience? Yes. For that I am so sorry. Unfortunately you were on the wrong end of a mistaken assumption. Please let the understanding that it was done by someone who wanted safety for your child, along with the consequences of being wrong if she were in actual danger, bring you some degree of peace.",frontierthrowaway123,138,1em18pe,na

lgwgou9,2024-08-07 14:38:55,"One last note, that I decided to just branch off in a comment.

I encountered someone being trafficked earlier in my career. I was riding alone on an hotel shuttle to the airport, with a younger woman who was gushing to another passenger about a job she was flying out to. Her story sounded off, so I started to ask a few questions myself. It was red flag after red flag. She had a hard time describing what the actual work is, it promised an unusual amount of money, she had little work background, no connections to the international city she was flying to... the list went on.

She disappeared at the airport before I could get into my suspicions with her. I spent the next hour, missing my own flight home, tracking down every airline that could get her to her destination in the time frame and speaking with their operations departments, along with airport police.

I never was able to find out if they reached her in time. Or if I was correct in my assumptions, if they did. But would I do it again? Absolutely. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew that I may have let somebody enter a life of slavery because I didn't speak up.

This is such a profoundly true statement. 
Once a victim is removed from the area they were trafficked from the chances of recovery diminish drastically.  No one in the new area is looking for them.  People don’t realize that trafficking victims look “normal”, so other people understandibly miss the signs because they are not trained to look for them.

lgxs1xl,2024-08-07 21:46:05,"Step into the wayback machine a number of years with me:  I'm a 45-year-old white male then, traveling alone with our adopted Asian daughter who was roughly 9 years old. What might you think?

When she was younger I did travel with her several times, alone, both by air and on a couple of gymnastics driving trips. Yes, I got a number of sideways glances, and our daughter got a number of nice sounding questions (mostly from women, and also from a few hotel managers) that when I thought about it were meant to figure out what our relationship was and if the situation with her might be sketchy. 

I brought along her passport, my passport and drivers license, a copy of my wife's passport, a couple of photos with our daughter &amp; my (white) wife &amp; me in them together, and even a notarized short note from my wife saying that my daughter and I were traveling together.

I probably would have done the same even if my daughter and I were the same race. 

Trafficking happens. And if you're a male (or appear to be) and traveling with a female that's noticeably younger than you, and especially if she's a minor, you're going to be looked at carefully at airports, highway rest stops, hotels, etc. 

Just be prepared for it, be polite and deal with it. 

No, it's probably not entirely fair, as women traveling alone with minors aren't looked at the same way, but then most sex traffickers aren't women… they're men.

lgy4d3d,2024-08-07 22:54:10,"Along with all the comments that say to stop looking at this as discrimination and to see it as a good thing to protect children. 

I want to point out that the last name difference was the FINAL thing that put the investigation in motion. It led credibility to the tip. 

So everyone saying ‘mismatched names happen all the time and I’m not stopped’ yeah, but there were other little red flags displayed along the way in this case. 

It’s not that 1 thing is going to cause an investigation, it’s a bunch of little things and the officer only mentioned the last one. 

Just because something bad happened to you doesn’t mean it’s due to your identity. You’re more than just a trans person. Something(s) you or your daughter were doing added up to be investigated. 

NOT EVERYTHING IS IDENTITY MOTIVATED. 

If an Asian guy cuts someone off in traffic and then is called a bad driver, it’s not a racially motivated comment, it’s cause they cut someone off in traffic. 

If a black guy with a big bag goes into a little store in an area of high crime, avoids eye contact, darts his eyes around the store, and runs off to the corner, and he’s stopped on the way out to check for shoplifting, it’s not because he’s black, it’s because a lot of little behaviors might’ve added up to suspicious behavior.

If you don’t pay to select a seat, it’s always best to check in at exactly 24 hrs before the flight takes off. It’s rare people are gonna pay for seats last minute but it’s literally available to do before boarding ends and very much can result in bumping someone on an oversold flight. Checking in 3 hours before take off almost guarantees you’ll be on of the people kicked off because it’s like last hired, first fired type of thing. If someone else was getting bumped/denied because they checked in after your wife and they buy their seat in that instance if it’s available, they’ll move on to the next person that checked in last and keep doing that. 

Checking in at the time many people arrive to the airport is not smart. This could of happened at any airline too, not just frontier. And it SURELY would happen this week regardless of the airlines despite today is not the weekend that tend to heavier travel than weekdays because a lot of people can only get off/can travel on weekends because a ton of people started their summer vacations this week and are always told Tuesday-Thursday are the cheapest days to fly so it’s a weekday surge in travel. Then on top it’s a holiday weekend (Memorial Day is monday) and many people try to travel before the weekend when it will surely be packed with holiday travelers. It was not smart to not only not but a seat, but check in last minute at the literal start of summer/Memorial Day weekend!

I get it that it sucks, and I absolutely wish it was illegal to oversell flights.  No one who bought a ticket should be denied, but unfortunately that's not the world we live in.  Typically they'll start by asking for volunteers and offering increasing sums of money to take the next flight before they get to the denial of boarding part.  I would genuinely be shocked if that didn't happen.

For the future, buy from the airline's website even if it costs a little bit more.  Chances are you're paying that much anyway in hidden fees through any of the reseller websites.

I bought the ticket from Frontier directly, and it happened to be a low cost (dropped to 78$ from 130$ or so a few days prior).

kxocs01,2024-04-02 18:04:56,"They bump lowest fair because they k ow they will have to pay.  It’s a policy to minimize their cost.    Situations when bumped passengers ARE eligible for compensation:

If you are not bumped from a flight for one of the reasons above, you qualify for involuntary denied boarding compensation if an airline requires you to give up your seat on an oversold flight and:
 
You have a confirmed reservation,
 
You checked-in to your flight on time,
 
You arrived at the departure gate on time, and
 
The airline cannot get you to your destination within one hour of your flight’s original arrival time.
If I am entitled to compensation, how is the amount of compensation calculated?

Passengers who are denied boarding involuntarily due to oversales are entitled to compensation that is based on the price of their ticket, the length of time that they are delayed in getting to their destination because of being denied boarding, and whether their flight is a domestic flight or an international flight leaving from the United States.  This is called “denied boarding compensation” or “DBC” for short.
 
Most bumped passengers who experience short delays on flights will receive compensation equal to double the one-way price of the flight they were bumped from, but airlines may limit this amount to up to $775.  Passengers experiencing longer delays on flights will receive payments of four times the one-way value of the flight they were bumped from, but airlines may limit this amount to up to $1,550.  Please see the tables below.
Domestic - Denied Boarding Compensation (DBC)

 
Length of Delay

0 to 1 hour arrival delay

No compensation

However, because you didn't book directly with them, it may be an issue. The travel service could probably contact frontier and take care of it, passing the fee and cost difference onto you, but there's always the chance it won't get resolved. In that case, I'd ask the service to refund you for the cost of that ticket and purchase it directly through frontier yourself for your friend. You must be further than 24hrs from departure to actually get a refund.

l63taqg,2024-05-29 03:00:27,"There are steps Frontier can and should take in these situations that won’t cost them a dime more out of their low fare pockets. First and foremost…  They should begin with transparent communications. Frontier gate agents should have announced the aircraft situation before beginning the boarding process. 

Next they should have asked for volunteers and offered those volunteers whatever compensation they planned to offer those who would be involuntarily bumped.  After asking for volunteers they should have next announced that if they don’t receive the number of volunteers needed, they will have to follow their policy of rebooking customers who were last to check in to the flight. 

These upfront communications would allow passengers to set their expectations accordingly in advance of boarding rather than standing in line and then told they can’t board. Customers would also be able to decide before boarding, if they want to stay back and let other family members continue the voyage without them… or they all stay back (which actually would then allow room for somebody else to be able to board). 

There would still be upset customers, but upfront transparent communications would allow travelers to make a more informed decision regarding their situation.",Crazy-Cancel-8084,7,1d2q535,l62bf4q

Frontier is notorious for not being customer focused in any way shape or form. There’s just too many examples of the poor treatment of their customers. 
That being said in today’s airports I highly doubt the airport is running the flight boards. The airlines have to update a system to show their flights, otherwise how would FlightAware or any other app get the information? One day this may happen to you and you’ll understand.

For real.

Everyone knows ""it"" is going to happen. ""it"" is different for everyone.

Frontier is unreliable, everyone knows it. But you take that into account. For many people ""it"" is the first time they fly Frontier. The plane was delayed, they had a tight connection they missed. The seats weren't up to par. They didn't factor in what Frontier *is*, you know? They will never fly it again.

Then you get the people who say, ""I don't need to be anywhere for 12 hours so long as this plane eventually takes off."" Cool. They are happy af with the on plane drink packages, happy with the chill, laid back demeanor of everyone they interact with. Then ""it"" happens, the plane takes longer to arrive than you could estimate with 3 standard deviations from the mean of all airlines, because this is *Frontier*.

This was me, missing my grandfather's funeral. The grandfather who I spent every weekend with. The grandfather who said, ""I hope you don't forget me,"" the last time I spoke to him. I spent 13 hours in LAS waiting to go there while we cycled through 3 planes, before Frontier swapped to a smaller plane, denied me boarding, and lied to the FAA to avoid paying me anything in return.

And then some people say, *yeah, frontier is a budget airline, be happy you went anywhere, or pay to get there when you want."" It doesn't surprise me you were told a bogus gate. It doesn't surprise me they moved it. It doesn't surprise me they did nothing to make it right.

I bet OP never returns to answer any questions and is either making this up entirely or something did happen but they are omitting a bunch of information where they messed up and exaggerating some parts to make themselves not seem at fault.

I’m guessing if there is any truth to this, OP wasn’t paying attention and didn’t see the gate change and by the time they went to check the board or online it was the time of the updated departure time so they rushed over to the new gate but the door had closed already so they made all these stupid details up to make it seem like there is a conspiracy against them.

Or maybe the flight delay got bumped up (updated from 2hr delay to like 90 min delay) and OP missed it and didn’t make it to the new gate in time. 

Or OP didn’t account for boarding to start 40 minutes before the new departure time and they closed the doors on them before they checked the board and saw there was a new gate.

What exactly was the “photo evidence” and why didn’t you post it here at all?

Also, I love how the victims of these Frontier conspiracies always know what the supervisor or gate agent is thinking even though it’s completely different from what they are saying but they don’t know that boarding starts 40 minutes before take off time and if you get to the gate at your take off time with 2 minutes to spare, the door will already be closed and it will be too late anyway.",droplivefred,-3,1b9ssg5,na

kr0vlc8,2024-02-19 02:37:32,"Tickets on Frontier are less expensive for a few reasons. They carefully manipulate how much of the ticket price is for actual fare vs. fees, which helps them minimize taxes. And as other commenters have noted, pretty much everything else will cost extra. This allows flyers who are more experienced, fly lighter, and who don’t need any frills to benefit from lower prices. Meanwhile Frontier will make up for this from people who have bags and want extras like seat selection, snacks, etc.

You also have to remember that the mainline US carriers just charge more overall. Delta for example has booming revenue and a strong customer base who can and will pay much higher fares. So there’s also an element of perception at play - you perceive the fares to be significantly lower (and they are) but that’s just in comparison to the big boys who charge more and have higher margins.",m3atxx,8,1au0f1y,na

Frontier won’t rebook you to another real airline, so even if there are hundreds of flights going to your destination, your trip might just end up cancelled.

The tickets are very cheap, but the vast bulk of folks I know who fly frontier regularly have at least one time where they’ve had to pay full ticket price last minute to another airline. That one ticket generally vaporizes most of the savings you got in the intervening time.

If you book on frontier, there’s a serious chance you may not end up at your destination on time. The ticket is cheaper because frontier doesn’t care: they are not at all phased by bad reviews and people shouting at them on the phone.

kooqguz,2024-02-03 10:58:33,"Here's how I book. Maybe this will help you. I'm a hardcore business traveler weaned on [ITA Matrix](https://matrix.itasoftware.com/search). I go there to find the exact itinerary I want (ITA doesn't actually *sell* any flights). *Then* I go to the site of the airline and book it.

So I spend a minimum of time monkeying around on the Frontier site because I already know what I want.

Now, in the last few years I've flown Frontier a lot because it's super freaking cheap. I'm a cheap motherfucker and trust me when I say I've done the math with spreadsheets comparing the real final cost AFTER baggage etc. Flown solo and with family. Saved thousands. And, I gotta say, I'm satisfied with the service. One of the most important things to understand with Frontier is that on their site they show an icon of a purse to represent a free personal item. If you read the actual measurements it's actually the size of an average backpack. They're trying to upsell the carry on but the allowed personal item is actually pretty large. There's even Amazon sellers with bags designed to fit the budget airline size for like $12. That's enough space for 3 days for me. Also their Discount Den is a decent deal by my calculations.

You may be able to ask for a refund of the unused portion(s) of the ticket if you don’t want to travel anymore, but that might not be guaranteed. “Significant” isn’t defined by either Frontier or DOT.

&gt;Schedule Change Prior to Day of Travel — When a passenger’s itinerary is changed because of a modification in Frontier’s schedule, arrangements will be made to:
&gt;
&gt;1) Transport the passenger over its own route system to the destination; or
&gt;
&gt;2) In the event Frontier determines that the schedule modification is significant, Frontier shall, if requested, provide passengers a refund of the cost of the unused portion of the ticket.

&gt;
&gt;- DOT has not specifically defined what constitutes a “significant delay.”  Whether you are entitled to a refund depends on many factors – including the length of the delay, the length of the flight, and your particular circumstances.

Okay, this one flies all the time and doesn’t react. Anyway, the gate agent tried to deny boarding because of that and I almost got put on the no-fly list for my temper but got it under control. All this to say that we were treated the same way for a similar situation and he never even flinched while this dog was all over his head trying to bite.

kqs81bx,2024-02-17 09:50:27,"I understand. I hate people who bring ill behaved dogs on flights. My dog reacted to a hostile dog appropriately, a single woof. My dog is level 2 schutzhund trained. Non reactive is not quite accurate. She watches everything but does not react when people kick her, run over her tail. She only reacted because a hostile dog got in our space and the reaction was appropriate.

She is a shepherd so people think they are violent. She is a real German german shepherd. Born and bred to be a service animal. In her five years, she has flown 100K miles so she is very comfortable in airports/planes.

My other pet peeve is when i get a lecture from someone that I should feed/water the dog and that they always need water.

Also, we always see things from our point of view based on our experiences. OP knows her dog and her background and credentials so she can tell what a bark means.

Sitting at the gate waiting and then hearing a loud large dog bark once will be startling if you didn’t hear the quieter barks of the small dog and just look over and see a German Shepard.

I assume that the gate agent only heard the German Shepard and didn’t see the whole situation. It could also be that the one bark was loud and frightened many people and maybe someone complained from the other passengers so they decided to take the complaint seriously. Maybe multiple people complained.

Heck, maybe that one bark was enough to intimidate people. I actually don’t know what the rules are for service animals so I can’t really say. 

I feel bad for OP because it sees they got treated unfairly but other people complaining about their bag been just the right size and seeing people at the gate with insanely huge bags complain has made me take everything I read here with a grain of salt.",droplivefred,5,1asps9p,na

kpgwofs,2024-02-08 19:14:08,This happened to me too. My afternoon flight kept getting delayed and then officially cancelled around midnight. Staff told everyone that we would get a hotel voucher for that night and we did not. Most of us stayed all night in the airport. The next day around 1pm we finally got on our flight and we received a $75 Frontier voucher. I went to use it and found out it only covered like $15 of the ticket and the rest was fees.

I got them to transfer the vouchers to me because I was the purchaser and my parents were not likely to ever fly again... They transferred them to me and I did lose part of the first voucher because I didn't use all of it at the same time.  When I called about it the agent educated me on the ""use it all at once or lose it feature of the vouchers"" and he offered to convert them all to $50 increments.  It took me a long time to use all of the vouchers and some expired before I used them but I called and explained my situation and they agreed to extend them a bit longer.  It was a different airline back then... When you could actually talk to a real person.  I believe you can still talk I someone but only after you've proved the need with a chat agent.

Just to let you know, there's two different types of items that you can carry on one is the personal item, second is a carry-on. 

People can bring carry-ons at a cost. The personal item is the one that is free and must fit freely into the sizer holder. Also personal items are supposed to be tucked under the seat in front of you, and if the plane is full you will hear the flight attendants asking if you have a personal item in the overhead please remove it and stick it under your seat.

The rest were bumped to the next flight out. Yes, they will compensate you 3Xs your fare, but it isn't your full fare(it's the actual price of your seat without the taxs/fees-- which on Frontier is normally under $50!)

The second time there was a $99 fee in addition to the $35 fee because I didn't notice they changed my flight again until about 23 hours before. So, a total of $169 just to keep my original ticket which was more than I paid for the ticket. Then, I got charged $99 to check my carryon bag because it was 31 pounds. They claimed 30 pounds was the limit. I later found it on their website, and it's 35 pounds. Also, I'm not sure the gate agent's right arm was calibrated that well when measuring weight. She was convinced my bag was too heavy since she saw an ice pack in it with my insulin when I was stuffing my purse in my bag because I already saw the gate agent try to charge someone for a purse.

It’s ridiculous, my bag got just fine under my seat so why am I paying $100? The book bag I bought was even made for frontiers size. They’ve become more expensive than most other companies. A nonstop American airline is $200 cheaper with 2 personal items and you get free snack &amp; drink. Frontier charges $70 for a personal item while most others charge less than $35.

They need to tightly control the time you come to the counter, because they have less staff to process flights. By limiting it to two hours, they can accurately predict how many customers will need to check in. 

They probably also have less luggage carts and baggage personnel so by doing this, they can also control how many bags are coming out to the loading area at once with nowhere to put them, and no staff to handle them. 

Someone else mentioned that legacy carriers also have limits. They do, but usually it is based on the specific airports policies, and how much room they have for storage and those airlines will have a list of the limits for each major airport.

The employees had to go upstairs to the gate to board the turnaround of the plane we landed on!

Our luggage and others luggage had been locked up in an area that only frontier has access to! We were told by the neighboring airline that if/when they came back down we would most likely be able to get our luggage!

Looks like there are still 3 flights before yours so they might be able to make up some time and not be delayed quite as long.

That being said I have been on flights that were delayed that late and didn't get cancelled so I'd hope for the best.

Southwest cheapest fares are over $100 more. Other airlines’ economy fares are $400 more. For some, that is worth reading and following the rules at a low cost airline. If Frontier didn’t have this fare available all the other fares would be a lot more expensive. So everyone that does find the savings “worth flying” Frontier is actually saving other people money when those other people fly on other airlines.

kvaxt8h,2024-03-18 01:02:04,"We were scheduled to fly back from Vegas to Atlanta at 11:45pm. My girlfriend and I got to the airport around 7pm because we were in a rental and had been there for 6 days, so we were done at that point. We waited for like 3 hours and the gate smelled like absolute shit. Apparently when the were pumping the septic lines out of the plane, it backed up and poured into the plane. But no one could give us an update until 2am when they say it's canceled until 8am. So we had to manage to sleep in the chairs and floors for 6 hours. My gf has epilepsy and it's super important for her to sleep, so that was a big risk. Keep in mind, we are 3 hours behind eastern standard time too. So 8am comes around and nothing is happening. Then they tell us the new pilot &amp; attendants have arrived but need a 3 hour rest period, so it'll be 11:30am. Knowing good and well when they told us 8:00am, they needed the 3 extra hours on top of that. We believe they told us the way they did, so they didn't have to pay for rooms for the night. 11:30am comes, the pilot and attendants are ready, but the 5th attendant wont be here until 1:00pm… And we cannot fly without 5 attendants. Which they already knew but didn't mention when they delayed it last time. She gets there at 1pm, and ""got lost"" in the airport. So we finally boarded at 1:45-2:00pm. A 14 hour delay. Was at the airport 17 hours. And a 4 hour flight home. So over a 20 hour process that could've easily been less than 8. We would've ben home early Friday morning. Instead, we finally got back home around 11pm. Worst experience of our lives. People were raging mad after the 8:00 delay to the point they had security and police guarding the Frontier employee that had ben giving us updates. Passengers were so bad they made her cry and leave. Which I understand, she's just a messenger, but damn. Never fly Frontier in your life. Big big mistake on our end.

kvxsdgo,2024-03-22 03:53:04,"I had a similar experience once with Frontier.

I was using a gym duffle bag for carry on. It only had like a pair of flippers, 1 shirt/pant and a small plastic bag for stationaries. So basically it was 80% empty.

I was asked by a gate agent to put it on the sizer because it ""looks"" to be oversized. I then put it the sizer and collapse the air out of the bag. It fits with plenty of room.

The gate agent then complaints that I can't ""Squeeze it into the sizer forcefully""

So I took it out, with one hand, now with the bag not holding all the air, drop it into the sizer again. 

She then gave me the annoyed look rolling her eyes up and goes ""whatever, go ahead""

The kick is, once I got on the plane I see they are filled with oversized hard carry-ons that definitely were bigger than what the sizer allows. Yet none were stopped.

Perhaps I might be the uneducated one here. If I was carrying a hard case then surely I would agree it was a problem. But a soft bag shouldn't be a problem, especially when it is collapsible.",chiggah,4,1bka6ai,na

A lot of Gate agents for Frontier are not hired directly by Frontier Airlines. They are through a third party company. Each company operates differently.

Frontier gate agents make money from the amount of carry-on bags they can get people to purchase. Therefore, they can be strict on what they consider to be allowable vs. not allowable. 

If you can prove damage - in this case, tossing out your bag because it's not allowed - and can prove that you were on another Frontier flight with the same bag, you might have a claim the DOT can investigate.

kwccccz,2024-03-24 22:27:40,"Former gate agent for a mainline airline now I’m a cabin crew member.  They can absolutely deny travel, but they have to document why for DOT reasons.  
The most common reason are due to being intoxicated.  From there I’d say arguing with the cabin crew or other passengers in the plane and lastly the gate agents over seating, bags and flights.    

The issue is that the FAA has a ton of rules and is ever changing.  The airlines and personnel have to follow them or get fined and it’s not cheap.  You never know when and where they are.  I know of a gate agent and flight attendant who got fined $5k for letting a person on with three bags.  So that is part of the reason why you see them enforcing somewhat abstract rules.  
Now as for Spirit and Frontier and their bag sizing and enforcement, that is a completely different story and I’m not a fan of the agents getting a bonus for checking them in at the gate.  That just encourages bad behavior, especially when they are contracted and not employees of the company where they are held to a higher standard.

What I recommend you do is always take pictures of your bag completely fitting in the sizer, pay the fee, keep the paperwork, get the name of the person.  If they refuse, tell them you are challenging them for their SIDA card as required in secure locations under airport ID requirements.  Be polite and then report all that information to the airline. If you get no traction you can let them know that you are making a complaint to the FAA or appropriate transportation authority for your country.  

Let me add in that being a gate agent is an extremely hard job compared to being a crew member when you line up the requirements side by side.  I did love doing it and miss my crew and my regular passengers I saw, but not the bad days there.  

Now I commute somewhat frequently on Spirit and Frontier, both for work and pleasure.  I already know what to expect from them ahead of time, so I’m prepared for that, but in general I’ve never had an unpleasant experience from the gate personnel and I’ve always had a good experience from the flight crew.

kr7r44j,2024-02-20 07:41:15,Wow... I was on the flight with the unruly passenger. They should have kicked this person off sooner because they spit water on a bunch of people before the flight even left the gate. Interesting to see the other side of the story for those who were supposed to be on the opposing flight. Frontier never communicated to us what was going on when we suddenly found ourselves landing in Philadelphia after being in the air for 1.5 hours. It was utter chaos in Philly with people screaming at the ticket desk and other frantically trying to book hotels (we managed to score a spot at the doubletree). Our flight was delayed 22 hours in total for us and all we got was a $15 meal voucher each.,WhyIWonder,14,1aupaxe,na
kr87wj7,2024-02-20 07:41:15,This is wild!! I did overhear someone say a flight got turned around. So I’m wondering why they had a stretcher and a guy needing a wheelchair at whatever flight did show up and then just didn’t take off. Also glad you got to leave the airport. I think just not having a set time for anything or like okay your flight is now delayed until 1 am was making us all crazy. We were just all  there in case something  else happened. And walking back and forth between 3 gates.,ShoweredBlueBlazered,6,1aupaxe,kr7r44j
kr59tu9,2024-02-19 23:19:34,"&gt; So what recourse do I have to get cash back? 

none. They got you home. If you have trip insurance, or booked with a credit card that offers it, you could claim any non-refundable expenses incurred due to the delay (food, hotel, etc.). Otherwise, you are SOL. Frontier does not have a generous delay policy and the US government does not require one.  You could have opted to cancel the flight for a full refund at the point of delay, but you would be on the hook to re-book with someone else.

&gt;Also will I ever get my bags back? 

probably. If you have a bag tag with your contact info, and even better a paper inside that has your contact info and itinerary, they will eventually get it to you. Again, if you have insurance, you can claim value of stuff you packed. If the bag is lost, then you can get money from Frontier for it.

&amp;#x200B;

The tough reality is the US does not strongly regulate airline quality. And if they complete the flight, there isn't much you will get back. This is why insurance exists. Frontier has about 450 flights per day. AA does about that many from PHL daily alone. The scale is so different. Frontier simply can't afford to have spare crews, spare aircraft, and better technology without raising costs significantly. When things go well, it is perfectly fine. When things go wrong, it is awful.",wildcat12321,28,1aupaxe,na

They were most like Southwest at the time: thick, comfy seats with decent leg room, TVs to watch, free checked bag, customer service was top notch and the flight attendants were actually friendly and entertaining. I had a Frontier credit card and racked up a bunch of miles for free trips. 

When they changed to their current model, I had a hard time being able to use my miles due to restrictions and when I did use them it was a terrible experience. The seats are ridiculous, spacing is horrendous, the employees are miserable. The final straw was using miles for a flight and then being told I would lose those miles when I had to cancel it less than 24 hours later. I decided right then that I would find a new credit card, use my current miles on short flights and never look back. 

My favorite though was when Frontier changed to their a la carte model, you could no longer pick your own seat and would have to take whatever they assigned you. If you wanted a specific seat you would have to pay and upgrade fee for it. One of the things they did was ask you to indicate in your profile what type of seat was your first choice, saying they would try to put you in that seat as much as possible. I didn't believe that for a second and indicated in my profile that I wanted a middle seat. Not once did I ever get my seat choice and they always put me in a window or aisle seat, which is what I really wanted and was able to get it without paying for the upgrade. Fuck you Frontier.

8. TREAT CUSTOMERS ON ""OVERBOOKED"" FLIGHTS FAIRLY
In the event that a flight is overbooked, we will solicit volunteers to give up their seats. As thanks for the cooperation of these volunteers, we provide alternative travel accommodations and an electronic voucher usable toward future transportation on a Frontier flight. It is our goal to find enough volunteers so that no customers are denied boarding involuntarily.

If there are not enough volunteers, other passengers who check in after all seats have been assigned may be denied boarding involuntarily. If you are involuntarily denied boarding, we will give you a written statement that describes your rights and explains how we determine boarding priority for an oversold flight. If there are fewer seats available than people who have checked in, generally, the last customer to check-in would be subject to removal.

In order to minimize the likelihood of getting denied boarding involuntarily, it is important that you check-in as early as possible. You can Check-In up to 24 hours in advance of your scheduled flight at FlyFrontier.com.",Demonkey44,1,1aebfge,na

kkcjg4f,2024-01-31 09:15:40,"Lawyer up. They made a contract with her that is she gave up her seat, they would compensate her with a specified amount.  

This creates an enforceable contract. Call Frontier legal and see what they have to say. Then contact the FAA and file a very detailed complaint, and include a written transcript of the videos you have of the interactions,ND include the video files on a jump drive in the letter. 

This is so blatantly in violation of FAA regulations, and very ell could become a topic the CFPB would also like to know about. Send the same complaint to them, just in case. 

Make several copies of the jump drive. Include photocopies of your tickets, your confirmation emails from Fronteir, and your proof of payment (usually the final screen telling you yay, you booked successfully). 

And then, sit back and wait. 

Or, go on a social media blitz. Find out who all of the fucked over passengers were. Publish their stories about any potential harship they've experienced as a result of this shit. All of you publish these stories (it will be more compelling if all the stories are in the same post) and all of you agree on a particular hashtag and use the same one. On the Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, hell, even Truth Social of you're a glutton for punishment, lol. 

Make a reddit thread. Submit it to all those sites that republish these kinds of things - Bored Panda, Chezburger, Failblog, all of those. It will blow the fuck up in Frontiers face.

I had so much time I was able to pull of their terms of carriage/or service. I forget the name. 
Anyway, we landed 8.5 hours late and I missed my connecting flight. I got lucky because that flight was also delayed and any delay over an hour Delta gives you the option to rebook even after flight has left.
I went to the gate agent like they said to in the terms as you’re entitled to a refund for the cost of the flight if it lands more than 8 hours late.
I even pulled it up for her to show her because she had no idea that was a thing. Called her supervisor and he wouldn’t honor it.
Haven’t taken Frontier since. They nickel and dime on everything to the point it costs the same as the better airlines. My friend booked a ticket through them recently and said there was even a charge now if you needed a gate agent to print your ticket for you. $20 per ticket each way.

Every single time I was given a hotel voucher, a voucher for a ride share to get me to the hotel, and the ability to pick from the free seats the next day. There was also one time where a flight was overbooked, and they needed 4 people to give up their seats. They kept raising the amount and eventually I was like hell why not, I didn't have much going on and could wait 24 hours. If I remember correctly, I got like 1k and also got vouchers for a hotel and rideshare as well as a flight out early the next morning.

She had a normal carry-on and a normal backpack, and they charged her $30 for the carry-on as she had trouble getting it in their sizer. (I understand if someone is trying to bring on a giant duffel or full size suitcase, but she had just had it a flight from another carrier without ANY issue. It fit just find in the overhead, etc.) They made her check it there at the gate, and then they didn't have gate-side pickup when we arrived so we had to go all the way to the baggage carousel to retrieve it.

I swear I love this sub for the horror stories and the number of people who admit they know what they are in for, yet willingly pay to walk right into it anyways...

I used to fly Frontier back before they were considered a major airline (circa 2006-2008). I liked them back then, seats were okay, customer service was good, prices were reasonable. Watching their decline to worst airline in the US has been a combination of sad and funny. 

I fly almost every week for work now and my whole team would quit on the spot if told to fly F9, NK, or even WN. I get why the ULCCs exist, and I'm glad they do, but damn is it funny the high expectations some people have. Your ticket was the cost of a meal for two at Applebee's.

kj0b38i,2024-01-22 14:35:52,"1. Some flights they are mega strict on sizing people's personal item, and other times they don't care. The times I recognized people staffing the gate that were also working the check-in counter, they weren't uber strict about bags. This is just my personal assumption - When the gate is staffed with contractors, sizing is uber strict because it is the contractors who get the bag bonus if they force someone to pay for a carry on. When it is staffed by actual Frontier employees, they are less strict because they don't get the bonus. You really have to plan ahead and set yourself up for success. Test bag prior to flight and make sure it FULLY fits into the sizer. Straps and everything! Nothing sticking up in the top. I have a photographer's vest that has big pockets. I can fit a packing cube with 5 days of clothes in one pocket. If you are wearing things it doesn't matter, I can throw packing cubes back into my bag on the plane.
2. Yeah seating sucks, but you get what you pay for. Last two flights(purchased together) they split me and my friend, but we don't care. We will see each other again at our destination.
3. For my last flight I paid $69.92 for TWO roundtrip flights SEA to DEN. I saved $66 in carrier fees by purchasing in person at the check-in counter in advance. Total cost of airfare for those 4 flight segments cost me $9.60, the rest is taxes. I definitely got my money's worth.

kizo8wd,2024-01-22 11:20:41,"I've had three recent Frontier flights, and booooy did I find out that there is there a learning curve with this airline! Love how cheap the flights are, so I'm trying to get this down to a science if I keep using them. Here's what I've found so far (about bags, seats, and general service):  
  
Seating sucks. If you want a guaranteed seat, pay. The check in time does NOT matter. First two flights, I was automatically thrown in a middle seat- I had checked in maybe a few hours beforehand. I was motivated by flight #3 to check in early and get a better seat. I checked in exactly 24 hours beforehand and was assigned a window seat. When I got the gate, though, my seat had been changed to another middle seat. I've seen that sometimes people will get lucky, but they definitely do not have to honor the original assignment if you're not paying for a specific seat. This also applies to booking tickets together with family- they do not have to sit you together (I talked to a family with a kiddo who had to play some musical chairs with other passengers because they didn't realize this). All of my flights were completely full.  
  
Next, the hot topic: bags! I've used the same backpack all three flights, with the exact same contents, assuming it would be a personal item. I ended up having to pay the carryon fee the first time around, but not the second two. The first flight, I had a part of my bag get caught on their metal ""sizer,"" so it didn't smush all the way down. ""You need to pay for a carryon!"" I found out that stepping out of the line to use my app vs. purchasing a carryon at the counter saved me a few bucks, but it still sucked having to pay for a bag that really did fit smoothly under the seat in front of me.   
  
The second two flights, I rehearsed placing my backpack into the sizer right when I arrived at my gate, way before boarding started. Huge help! Second flight, I was waved through with my qualified personal item after sliding it into the sizer. Third flight, they just eyeballed my bag and waved me through. Not all crews are built the same!  
  
I saw at least two or three people ahead of me during boarding with super small bags that had awkward dimensions who, maybe if they figured out the gameplan of how to put the bag in beforehand, totally would have gotten away with it being a personal item. Definitely be careful with wheels and straps. You will 100% be rushed through, and if your bag isn't able to fit in within the first few seconds of you approaching their sizers during boarding, there's a good chance they'll wave you over to the carryon line.  
  
I'm not playing around with their checked bag fees (I'll fly Southwest anytime I plan to check luggage).   
  
Overall, it seems like what you might expect for a budget flight. Ya get what you pay for. Cramped and stiff seats, food and drink are extra $$$, and the staff can be snippy (there's no way they're paid enough). I had two interactions with customer service (website chat), and got two completely different answers, but ultimately got the help I needed. I'm sure I still have tricks to learn!",1Rain2RuleThemAll,4,19clx0a,na

kj0g23w,2024-01-22 15:30:57,"1) You can set your seat preference in your account, giving a better chances at your randomly selected seat being the type of seat you want  (window, aisle, middle).

2) The earlier you check in within the 24 hour window, the better seat you get (again, aisle or window). I typically check in EXACTLY 24 hrs out.

3) Tickets are significantly cheaper if you book at the airport.

4) If you have status, seat selection and free carryons are pretty legit benefits. Their new lowest tier (silver tier) allows free seat selection and priority boarding. GoWild All-you-can-fly passholders who bought this year’s annual pass before the end of last august got Silver status for free. As a GoWild passholder, it has been an absolute game changer.

5) Don’t be an idiot with the personal item. I’ve never (ever) had to pay for it a bag in all my 50+ flights on frontier. Just measure it before you leave home and make sure it fits the sizer when you get to the airport.

6) If you MUST check a bag, only do it on direct flights and make sure you get there EARLY before the bag check opens 2 hours before departure.

7) Be nice to the gate agents and flight crew, and they’ll be nice to you. They’re people.",Eagles365or366,3,19clx0a,na

kj3my1b,2024-01-23 05:28:25,"I think the biggest trick with Frontier is just to know their baggage rules. All the airports I’ve flown in and out of had horrendous lines to check bags and they’ll cut you off. On one flight I waited in line for 2 hours only to have them stop accepting bags at the person in front of me. They told me I’d need to book the next flight. I just took my bag to the gate and they actually gate checked it for free but I haven’t tried to check a bag since. 

I’ve flown with just a backpack and they always check the size, so it can’t be too full. They’re the only airline that’s this strict, Spirit doesn’t look twice at the same backpack. I also occasionally pay for a carry on and know my suitcase fits in their sizer exactly. 

I don’t really mind sitting wherever but I do pretend to purchase a seat before checking in to see what’s still open. Sometimes you can time it just right when there are more good seats than bad seats still left and know when to check in to get a good one. I usually end up with front aisle seats this way.",Sugarsesame,1,19clx0a,na

So I waited until it was less than 24 hours from my second flight and still no dice. Again contacted chat, they told me my boarding pass would appear when I landed at my connecting airport. I was highly suspicious at this point so was mentally prepared to seek help at the connecting airport. Lo and behold, boarding pass did not appear at my connecting airport.

Use a web browser instead and take a picture of all boarding passes especially if you’re on a connecting flight.

k17q79v,2023-09-19 09:46:28,I’ve had my last few flights only give me the 1st of 2 boarding passes when I checked in but I always go to the gate agent when I get there and they always print me physical passes. I have a go wild pass and have flown almost every other weekend since March(SLC TO MDW and back).,SpaceGangsta,1,16mcuwd,na
k18h8kb,2023-09-19 13:28:53,"OK… so you flew ATL-DEN-SLC on 9/14/23 and your problems occurred at DEN. It helps to define timelines like this.

DEN has nice sleep areas in the airport. I am sorry that you weren’t told about them and had to suffer on the floor.

Your DEN-SLC boarding pass never appeared in the app. It is supposed to generate two boarding passes but only one appeared. This is a known problem that will probably take a lawsuit to resolve. I can’t afford to file it, but I would. It happened to me last week. I am a frequent flyer and know how to handle it, so it did not affect my travel.

The solution for this is to approach the gate agents far in advance of boarding to get the boarding pass printed. This catches mostly layover fliers because you don’t need to use the non-existent pass to clear security once you are airside. The rest have to get it landslide at the horrendously slow baggage checkin line that can lead to them missing the flight.

Instead of telling you to go away, they should have been telling you to use WhatsApp to contact customer service. Do not use web chat because it is known to randomly drop connection without notice.

Frontier vs Delta during that week. 9/8, 9/11, 9/12, 9/14

Frontier - I flew 6 segments SFO-PHL-SFO-LGA and at least one of them had this problem. I’ll check if any more did. Don’t try this at home unless you are fully prepared with accessories like special pillows. Price $25-30 per trip.

I checked. I didn’t get a boarding pass on 9/11 for my DFW-SFO segment.

Delta - I flew two final segments LGA-ATL-SFO. I overslept my boarding while sitting at the gate. Gate agent instantly booked me standby without a confirmed seat on the parallel flight to Atlanta and rerouted me from SJC to SFO. Upon checkin at the gate, Delta assigned me to front row of Comfort+! The next flight was equally uneventful in my confirmed seat. No fees were mentioned. Price - 9000 Chase points, roughly $140. I have no status with Delta. I took that Delta flight because I needed to be at a meeting sooner than Frontier would get me there, so no problem there.",wiseleo,0,16mcuwd,na

kf06hfz,2023-12-27 00:55:48,"Frontier is very specific about personal baggage size.  If it doesn't fit in the sizer, then you have to pay for a carry-on fee.  All of that makes sense.

What doesn't make sense, and seems illegal, is for you to be charged for a bag that fit into the sizer in a position that the gate agent didn't prefer.  That is not what Frontier's rule says.  The rule is that the personal bag must fit in the sizer, period.  

Now if the wheels were sticking out, that means it didn't fit.  I once bought a specific carry-on for under the seat, and when I took it to the airport the wheels stuck out a little in the sizer.  It didn't fit, so for the next time I traveled with a personal bag I bought one that for SURE fit.  I was still nastily harassed by the gate agent on one flight last year, having to put the personal bag in the sizer TWICE to make sure she saw it.

Anyway, if your bag truly did fit in the sizer, contact the DOT, your state Attorney General, and also reverse the charges on your credit card.  Until we all put our foot down, the insanity will continue.  Either walk with your feet (fly with another line), or fight the charges (if they truly are illegitimate).",[deleted],7,18r9y5e,na

I apologize to OP if it fit in the sizer and that I’m suspicious in that case but there are far too many posts where people distract from the main issue of the bag fitting in the SIZER and mention a special trip, old relatives, and the bag fitting easily under the seat to cover the fact that their bag is larger than the sizer and deserves to be charged.

As long as their policy is properly communicated to the public then there shouldn't be any complaints (beyond the occasional expected grump).

HOWEVER, Frontier shot themselves in the foot by not making their policy simple, cohesive or consistent.  Some Frontier gates allow obviously oversized bags and don't say a word.  Some gates only make some people size their bags, while letting others with extra airport shopping bags walk right by.  And some Frontier gates are nazi's and make EVERYONE size their bags.

I fly from NJ to FL twice a month, at my own expense, so even if I eventually have to pay, the convenience of a small airport and the $29 one way hobo class fares keep me coming back.

That said, I’m one of the people who never looked at vertical v horizontal in the bag sizer. Next time I fly I’ll take a look. My backpack is a pretty badass Patagonia with lots of straps.

I used the measurements on Frontier’s website to ensure I purchased the right size bag. I’ve used it many times without issue. Then a couple weeks ago my daughter used it to travel Frontier. Her first flight out was fine. No issues. On the way back however, the gate attendant made her pay for it as a carry-on. It’s like they can pick and choose whose day they want to ruin. And we have no power to fight it. As someone else said, they don’t have to let us board and they don’t care if we miss our flight. 

They wanted to charge her $99, but she called me and I was able to purchase a carry-on bag through the app for $69. So, pro tip, if you find yourself in a similar position, get onto their app, and pay for a carry-on through the app, even if you’re in the boarding line.

Let me tell you a story. Before I retired I worked for a major University with a huge football stadium that was filled to capacity for every home game. We often had to eject people from the stadium for not following simple rules. Some that didn't get ejected did get told to start following the rules or they would be ejected. And some got mad because they wanted us to make someone else in the Stadium stop doing something that they didn't like, but wasn't against the rules (we didn't.)

I would 9 out of 10 of the people who got in trouble or didn't get their way for trying to get someone else in trouble (the people next to you are yelling too loudly? Not obscenities, just loudly? And you don't like it? Go to the opera and not a football game next time. And no, I won't tell the announcer to speak more softly into the microphone because your seat happens to be under the speaker. Nope. I could go on....) told me that they were NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS GODFORSAKEN STADIUM! Guess what? No one cared. You don't want that seat? Great we'll sell it to someone else and can charge them more because if you had ""season tickets"" you were sort of grandfathered in and could keep those seats by paying the ticket price plus whatever extra ""donation"" you had been making since time began. For a new person to buy those seats, they were going to have to pay ticket price plus their ""donation"" was going to be significantly more than yours. So, bye.

People act like I’m a corporate shill when I say good things about Frontier, but like all gambling, the ultra low cost carriers are a numbers game. Fly them enough and you’ll probably get hit with a bag fee or a crap seating assignment or a delay/cancellation that makes you buy an expensive seat on a different airline to get home. But if you fly them enough, you’ll probably have lots and lots of unproblematic flights, too. The money you save on the smooth flights is what makes you come out ahead even if you get that $99 bag fee. Like should I fly Frontier where I might pay $99 for my bag or should I fly Southwest where I’ll pay $150 more for my ticket but get “free” bags?

Our luggage is medium size so even packed to the max it barely hits 32-35 lbs and the limit for checked bags is based off of a large sized luggage and 40lbs max. We aren’t super big on sneakers so any sneakers we want to bring we just wear to the airport. Running shoes are soft and can sort of mold in shape so they fit in the checked in bag.

One mishap mistake and the consumer is on their own. Delayed flights often mean that a crew times out, timed out crew means the flight can't go anywhere. That also results in ticket holders stranded, and missed connections. The whole frontier system easily snowballs into catastrophic issues for many customers. But wait there is more to it. Since it is a skeleton system there is no customer service. I.e. you are on your own to resolve your delay at that very moment combined with the complexity of last minute flight bookings.  I could go on but the reality is when you book with budget airlines you are booking a higher risk reservation.

This is the SECOND TIME  I was screwed by Frontier.   Should have learned my lesson the first time.

But on both occasions, they canceled my flights, both legs of the round trip, with less than 1 week notice.  They offered no alternative booking, so I had to scramble for tickets with another airline at the last minute and ended up paying much more than I would have if I had booked a different airline months ago.  So , bottom line.  You don't save money by booking with this second rate airline.  You end up spending more in addition to the added hassles.   I also had travel insurance, but it did not cover the added cost of changing airlines.  It would only have covered it if I was at the airport on the day of travel and got canceled.

What amazed me was everyone talking how strict Frontier was with the personal item size so we paid for the carry on which turned out to be a waste of money.  Let me tell you, the Frontier agents didn't seem to give one single fuck coming or going.  People going on with ridiculously sized items which clearly would not fit in the bins.

I've since purchased a personal item bag that's the exact dimensions of the bin and should hold a lot of stuff so I can avoid the carry on penalty in the future but honestly, they never measured my bag nor my girlfriends.

kqbq4px,2024-02-14 09:51:09,"I used to have your opinion, on my first 5 or so frontier flights - then i had 2 bad experiences in a row. 

1. Flew my mom out on Frontier to visit me, she was on the tarmack ready to go, and they delayed, delayed, then cancelled the flight around 1am. Next flight she could get on was 11pm next day - no refunds, no hotel for the night, nothing. There were no weather conditions either. Since it was just a weekend trip, she never made it and I spent around 300 including flight, ubers to the airport, and hotel for her, and i didnt even get to see her. Id rather book an airline that would at least refund me if that happened.

2. Had a rough flight from California to Chicago with a layover in Vegas. Flight was delayed three hours, then once we were ready to fly out apparently the back of the plane was too heavy, so they threw 13 people off the plane. Then it was time to go and they realized they were out of fuel, so another delay. That same trip on the way back i watched one gate agent make 20 people pay $100 for bags that clearly fit in the size measurer, including my backpack, which 3 other gate agents that same trip said was small enough. I took a picture of it fitting in the sizer, sent a complaint to frontier and my credit card company, and got the money back. But you never know when you are going to get a corrupt gate agent when they incentivize the bag policy like that. 

I know this is only 2 different experiences - but ive had delays/cancellations/etc with all of the other airlines, and they at least treat you like a human. They apologize for the inconvenience, either conveniently rebook you, refund you, or both, give you hotel/uber/food credits, etc.  

the gate agent at frontier basically told me to go F myself(and everyone else) when i said my backpack did fit in the sizer. They basically told my mom to go F herself when she asked them to pay for her hotel for the night when they cancelled her flight in the middle of the night.

They absolutely do take attendance at the gate, they track you when you board. You don't have to board as soon as your group is called, but there's a last-call and if you miss that time, they can give away your seat.

They ask that you be at the gate 30 minutes before departure:

[https://faq.flyfrontier.com/help/when-do-i-need-to-check-in-for-my-flight](https://faq.flyfrontier.com/help/when-do-i-need-to-check-in-for-my-flight)

&gt;Please be at the gate and ready to board no later than 30 minutes before departure.

And their contract of carriage says that they can give your seat away if you're not there 20 minutes before:

[https://f9prodcdn.azureedge.net/media/9690/cs\_coc.pdf](https://f9prodcdn.azureedge.net/media/9690/cs_coc.pdf)

&gt;E. Availability for Boarding - Tickets and seat assignments are subject to cancellation for passengers who fail to make themselves available for boarding at the departure gate at least 20 minutes prior to scheduled departure.

So that's how they know when you're ""late"". If you get there less than 20 minutes before departure, they can give away your seat and treat you as a no-show.",Odd_Drop5561,4,1cac53j,l0srqqi

Fact!

I was there 2.5 hours before departure.

Can't get a bag sticker till 2 hours before departure.

The bag line was 80 minutes.
Not a typo, EIGHTY MINUTES. 
To check a single bag! (25% under weight, that had to piss them off).

Then you have the TSA Line, and that is ""MY"" fault?

I don't think so.

They were the cause with their $10 incentives to bang as many people as they could.

Which slowed the line (bag drop) to a complete standstill.

Never have I seen anything like it.

Saying they suck is being too nice. They are pathetic.
Low life pieces of shit.

Nope...

l0vuxyk,2024-04-23 21:12:58,"Flying out of Orlando and needing to check luggage is always risky. I fly out of MCO all the time and I'd never check a bag because I've seen the long lines at the Frontier luggage check in counter. 

Guaranteed that most  people in line ahead of you didn't use the available kiosks to print out their luggage tags and put it on their bags before getting in line. If they did, each person would be taken care of in 5 seconds and the line would move very quickly.

The TSA lines can also be incredibly long at MCO. I've seen the lines stretch way down the hall and likely take close to 2 hours to get through. I've also seen short lines that only take about 10 minutes. It depends on the day of the week and the time of day. 

Definitely worth paying for TSA Precheck if you fly out of a busy airport like Orlando. The Precheck line is always shorter and faster. Fewer people in front of you will pack prohibited items or forget to empty their pockets before going through the scanner. No matter how many times instructions are repeated to them, many people in the regular line will not have their ID and boarding passes ready or pockets empty when they get to the head of the line. It slows everyone else down. 

Also, always check in online as soon as possible. I check in 24 hours ahead of time every time I fly on any airline. I've never had a problem that was not weather related in any flight I've been on. 

Always a good idea to check flightaware.com to keep an eye on where the plane you hope to board actually is located in real time.

If you cannot talk to a supervisor on the ground, you will have a very hard time addressing any issue.  

If you have ever lost bags on an airline, you know they are part of the global bag tracking system.  This does not exist for Frontier.  The poor gal in Denver showed me their process. A bad photocopy piece of paper where they write down the bagage detail.  
The staff at the gate cannot rebook, cannot out you in standby, cannot see any detail on future flights.   Everything needs to be done at customer service, or via the app/chat.  
To rebook a flight, you are suppose to get a email to do so when you missed a connection.  Half of us did, half did not.   Our link did not work.   Good thing I took screenshots, thats how I got my refund for the flight I booked.  It was such a surreal experience.",ashman77,7,1byhlh7,kyjeegj

Boss is a perceptive guy and felt the situation out. She admitted that there was only the one time that she was pretty sure of (which even that wasn't true), and the test was the creepy vibe. He called a lawyer in her presence and asked if they should sanction me. The lawyer said there was no case for it. She hasn't bothered me since.

Never book connecting flights, direct only, always use a mainline carrier when your schedule isn't flexible ie. for business trips, get there early, follow their rules (they do make them clear generally people just think they can ignore them), and have low expectations. Following these has saved me from encountering the situations that result in the vast majority of complaints I see on here.

They can be and are a great fit for the right travel plans, and they have allowed my family to fly to many destinations that I would not afford to fly on a mainline carrier, but you definitely have to understand that basically anything can happen and you're essentially betting your savings each time for the possible case where you are delayed or cancelled and have to pay extra money for hotel room or for last minute tickets on another airline.",K0DEAN,23,1aqpcvm,na

It happened another time when I was booked on a Northwest Orient flight that got suddenly canceled and Northwest had me put on a Capitol Airlines flight that was the next flight to that destination.

Nowadays if you wanna be treated like royalty or just plain decently you gotta pay for it.But nickel and dime airlines like Frontier and Spirit seem to go out of their way to make things difficult and uncomfortable. I mean come on is it so really unreasonable to at least have a reclining seat or should we have to pay for that luxury.

It's basically a gamble. If everything works well, then I just got where I needed for $39. When it doesn't I just lost the bet and lost $39--I throw it away and cut my losses. 

I pretty much never fly them, not because of being out the $39 and having to buy another ticket, but because I don't have flexibility on time and canceled flights. But when its just a for fun trip and if it gets canceled I just don't go, its sometimes hard to pass up that fare.

Frontier flew 25.5 million passengers last year, and we get a couple people a day that had a bad experience. Some of those it's the agents fault, Some it is the passengers fault, and Some it is weather.

Frontier handles some of the things well, and some things don't go well. My family of 5 plus my kids families have bought probably 300 tickets on frontier over the last 5 years and we have had issues with one ticket on one flight.

We have had delays, but we don't cut things too close. We also don't usually fly on very busy holidays. We also try to be very nice to the employees.

Every carrier has issues, with Frontier it's hard to talk to a person and get something reasonably resolved. it's an issue they have. 

One of the biggest reasons people have a very hard time with them is it can be so expensive to have a flight interruption / issue. I think people in general need to try to budget more time with their air travel. 1 hour layovers and flying in the day of your cruise are just reckless.

Sure, walking away from a super cheap fare if you are at your home airport is low risk.  Maybe it costs you a fun weekend away somewhere.  The real risk is potential costs you need to incur to get home if you are stranded on the return leg of your trip.

Since Frontier has significantly fewer frequencies than the legacy carriers (UA, DL, AA) and Southwest and they won't put you on another airline to get you home, the 'rescheduled' flight could be up to days later - this sub has some real horror stories.  That means missing work, hotel spend or purchasing an expensive one way on another airline. Travel insurance may help.

2. Lots of people have expectations that Frontier is the same as Delta at a lower price. They are sorely mistaken.

Frontier is an ultra-low-cost-carrier. That means they try to cut every possible corner. They have less staff, fewer planes, operate a more crowded schedule with less slack and spare crew/planes. They don't re-accomodate on other airlines. They nickel and dime for every option - regardless of whether you agree or not. They do not hold your hand or coddle you, they expect you to be at the right place at the right time, early in fact.

If you know what you are getting into, they often meet that very basic minimal service associated with a low fare. If you don't, you will complain. If something goes wrong, especially if you chose not to get insurance, then you will likely be upset.",wildcat12321,1,1bsm1l7,na

My daughter solved the problem by taking the sweatshirt (the only item in the bag) out of it and putting it on. Then rolled up the bag (a reusable grocery bag that folds into the size of a deck of cards) and put  it into the front pocket of her hoodie.

Frontier didn’t have any digital check in/boarding passes for my particular flight, even though it was available for other flights. So I rush to the check in desk, and by the time I’m served, it’s about 50 minutes till my flight. No real concern since our airport security line was always short. They refused to print my boarding pass because it was too close to my flight. I asked for a manager, same decision. I called customer service, same deal. So I went and checked with Delta - no flights left. I checked with Southwest and got one from them. Went through security, bought a sandwich and coffee, then walked to my original Frontier gate and watched them call final boarding on my original flight. 

My suspicion is that since it was Thanksgiving, they closed off the digital check in because they’d overbooked the flight and wanted to throw more hurdles in the way to prevent some passengers from getting to the plane, because then they wouldn’t be required to reimburse passengers who got bumped. After all, the passenger violated their arbitrary policies. 

Frontier is ultimately a scam company with an airline side business. I’ve taken it once since this incident when I had a $500 difference between it and the next possible ticket, but I avoid it as much as financially possible.

l0woq4e,2024-04-24 00:11:19,"Whatever post you saw was utter crap anyway.

Getting a discount when booking at the airport was something that was a thing decades ago. Back when most of us used travel agents to book flights, so the airline saved money if you booked at the airport with an agent, because they (had) to pay a fee to the travel agency. 

Now, some airlines will Charge you a fee if you book in person or on the phone, because it costs them $ in time, by taking the agent away from other jobs they could be doing, and because they can get away with it. 


By the way, seats showing availability on an airline that charges to pick a seat, essentially means nothing.

I used to be one of yall, I loved Frontier. Thing is, when they fuck up they fuck up baaaad.

- They will cancel flights the day of and may take hours before letting you know.
- The refund process is hit or miss, sometimes it works other times it's painfully slow or they try to give you vouchers rather than a refund
- If you need any help, they have no phone support. Only whatsapp texting and email
- Unless you're going to a hub, they don't fly as many flights as other airlines so rebooking you is not always a routine easy process

Other issues: 

- They scrutinize personal items at the gate. They are directly incentivized to gate check personal items since they receive a commission for doing so. There are horror stories of them not even measuring bags but just eyeballing them and still applying the fee. There is a pending class action lawsuit for this.
- Bag prices have skyrocketed. They used to only be $30 one way, now are $58-65 one way.
- They have shitty hidden fees. They charge $23 for buying tickets online on their website (as opposed to in the airport). They sometimes charge $5 for printing a boarding pass at home (rather than using the app).

The list goes on.

Seems like Frontier in SFO is similar to Atlanta in that regard, I'll have to try them out one day. 

I will say just be on alert flying back home out of MCO if you're flying Frontier again. They're a little more strict about the bags in my experience. Last time I flew out of there the supervisor was checking bags and told me I had to have my food I bought at the airport in my bag, then she added that the jacket I was wearing had to fit inside too so I have to pay. Obviously I didn't want to pay $100 so I reorganized my bag and made everything fit in the sizer. She then changed it and said I can't push it in and it needs to slide in.

Were you at the end of the terminal at DIA - where you have to unload outside and go down a ramp? It was ridiculous.

We had to run off the plane because the FAs were yelling ""HURRY! HURRY! KEEP GOING!!!!"" and hope we had all of our belongings.

l3baffm,2024-05-09 00:41:11,"I would rather wait a couple of minutes boarding than miss my flight from a ridiculous 80-minute bag drop line. Their is ZERO defense for that. 

Having pretty much done just carry on for the last 20 years,  I have grown accustomed to that speed.
No problem.
And it really is not that long in time.

On my flight, nearly all that I saw had a carry-on.
It went at the same pace as any other, and I thought nothing of it.

And it seems all the other ""real"" airlines don't seem to have any issues in doing so in a timely manner.

So that is a weak reason to validate, to say the least. 

I'm curious how you would defend Frontier, having me wait 80 minutes to drop my bag, and it was 27 lbs, not one that was over 40 lb bag. 
And there were plenty of people behind me to go yet, and I was there 30 minutes before I could get the bag check sticker. So what did ""I "" do wrong, that caused me to miss my flight.  (The next step was TSA and that was 80 minutes, too.

I can only narrow it down to:

1. Should not have taken Frontier (sadly, I didn't know they went to shit, they were fine the last time I used them in 2017). Hind site is always 20-20.

2. Not take a bag to check, again had no idea they were such a Clown show . But I had no choice as I needed the room for my return flight. 

3. Take the bag to the gate, and let them take it. I saw someone say they do that last week, (to late for me though). As they paid ahead already and avoided that ridiculous line of rabid contractors looking for any excuse to make another $10 bucks &amp; the rest of the line be damned, and show everything down.

Just so you know, over 60 people missed that flight due to that line, which is designed to fail. 
And no,  I shouldn't HAVE to have TSA Pre screen just to use Frontier. I don't need it for ANY other airlines, none. Not in this country, Mexico, Jamaica. Aruba, St. Martin, Bahamas.
Just a Frontier issue since they choose to go the shit show route.",Spare_Pollution_6088,3,1cn8yiu,l35hwyt

Woke up in the morning to aircraft change email from them and the assigned seat was not showing up anymore on the boarding pass. They had offered $250 voucher if we chose alternate options. Rushed to the airport and managed to get on standby for being early.

After the boarding was complete, there were 7 people at the gate waiting for a seat and only 2 seats were available. A group of 4 had only 2 confirmed seats and there were us and another couple  waiting. The group of 4 were willing to travel only if all of them could be placed on the flight and they were willing to give up their 2 confirmed seats otherwise. We and another couple really wanted to be on the flight and were not willing to give up the seat. The gate agent without talking to us and the other couple gave the 2 available seats to the group who were ready to give up their seats without checking with us when we badly wanted to be on the flight. I had gone multiple times to the gate agent for update and they had sent me back. The people who got the seat just happened to be in front of the agent when he was assigning the two seats. We were right behind them. No standby priority was followed. The other couple and us checked in much earlier than the ones who got the seat. Terrible handling by them.

This was Saturday morning and the gate agent said they had no other flights till Monday even though I saw their Sunday flight still taking reservations at that time. As of Saturday night, I still see Sunday flight taking reservations online. I ended up booking Southwest for Sunday immediately after the gate closed (thankfully minutes before Southwest was sold out)

I missed first day of our resort booking which I had booked an year in advance. The $250 each compensation voucher by Frontier barely covers the last minute booking I did for the next day on Southwest. Not to mention the missed $1000 a night hotel room and other expenses. It sucks that aircraft change is not qualified for cash compensation as per DOT rules.

Terrible handling by Frontier and no good alternative options. They couldn't guarantee us seats even when we were ready for an overnight layover at MCO.

What I learnt out of this is if you have a choice of seat, book the seats at the front (with exception of few seats that are missing near emergency exit on some aircrafts) so in case of aircraft change, you still have your seat.",CantGoTitsUp,2,1at53od,na

Flying the cheapest possible airline only to miss out on $1000/night hotel room.   Oh the irony!  

DOT rules do not allow airline to remove a passenger after gate agent has accepted boarding pass and permitted boarding unless it’s for safety or bad behavior.  

DOT also requires refund in event of cancelation or significant delay.  This is not the same as compensation like a flight credit.  It’s just giving you back the $59 you paid to take flight that operates 3 days a week, leaving you few options on the event of an operational snafu.  But that $59 refund won’t help when you’re trying to book a trip to Mexico on the same day with another airline.

Every single one of those flights was 6+ hours delayed.
My flight landed 8.5 hours late. Per their terms of carriage (because when you stand in a line for 5 hours you have time to look up terms of carriage) anything over 8 hours they owed me a refund.
Went straight to the gate agent at landing to start filing the issue. Her and one boss were the only Frontier employees still at the Minneapolis airport. Both said they had never heard of that clause, despite me showing and pulling it up for them and refused to do anything.

I had been living in San Diego for ten years, up until I moved last year, and visited my family in Phoenix fairly frequently for quick weekend trips. Frontier worked for me - it was dirt cheap, I once got a round trip for $25! And the flight time was about 30 mins in the air. I kept some clothes and hygiene stuff at my parents house so I only needed to pack a few things into a special, tiny little suitcase I bought on Amazon. It was advertised as personal item size - it was a small rolling bag, with wheels and a handle, but tiny and square shaped and fit perfectly under the seat. Much better than a lot of people’s bags do. Well one day, out of the blue, after many flights flown with them, the gate agent decided they were going to have everyone put their bags in the sizers. I’ve never seen them do that before, especially for personal items. No worries I thought, I’m all good. Well lo and behold, I put my bag up there, and it doesn’t fit, because of the wheels! I thought there had to be a problem but it occurred to me in that moment that I never really measured it myself I guess? I mean this bag is tinier than the sizer but because of the wheels I couldn’t shove it down in there. They charged me $120 at the gate for it!! They snagged a couple other people too! I could hardly believe the whole ordeal. That was like 3x what I paid for the fare. I tried telling the gate agent that I’ve taken this bag on MANY flights, and it fits perfectly under the seat, but they weren’t hearing me. Oh man I was soooooo pissed.

Now I live in TN - and guess what my choices are from Nash to Phoenix? Frontier and Southwest 🙃 I swore I would never use Frontier for long flights but I have tried it once thus far 😂 and didn’t have a bad experience, but it’s caused me to like Southwest a lot actually. I hate their dumb seating system but they have grown on me. Particularly the WiFi for $8 thing is really great for a four hour flight, and now that I’m staying in Phoenix for a little longer than 48 hours, I need to pack more stuff, so the free bag is nice. 

Anyway, rant over, Frontier sucks but I legit hate them all, they’re all SO scummy and cheap and no matter how much they shit on us they just keep getting billions of taxpayer dollars to prop their poorly-managed asses back up again.",GoatCam3000,2,1bu22un,na

Long story short, they had boarded the plane before it had originally being delayed, and despite the fact that the doors had not been closed (obviously not as there was still 30 minutes until departure), they had given our seats away. They forced us off the plane and told us if there were seats leftover that we would be able to fly, otherwise we were out of luck. They were so rude and it was so embarrassing.

I was an airline gate agent for years for a major US airline. 

This happens all the time. Every US carrier does this except Southwest because Southwest only uses one type of airplane. In the airline industry, all airlines have about the same reliability. The only major difference is discount carriers cannot rebook you on different airlines whereas traditional carriers have contracts that allow them to rebook you on different airlines 

Also know that in 2024 every paying airline passenger in the US is a loss leader, meaning the airline loses money when they fly you on their airplane - about 0.6 cents per passenger per mile. If you don't fly any US airline again, they'll find someone else to fill your seat. It's easy because the price of the ticket is below cost.",savehoward,-1,1bmyffw,na

The Point-to-Point model means less options between your origin and destination (sometimes only 1 per day or less). Additionally, these airlines focus on high load factors (meaning flights are usually very full), and high utilization (extra planes are not available).

Weather brings its own challenges: airports get closed, reopened, then closed again, and ATC delays flights to prevent congestion.

You add this all together and you get a mess. Planes and crew aren’t in the right places, so flights get cancelled. Displaced passengers have to be squeezed onto other flights (which takes days). Operations and call centers get overwhelmed with all the changes.

Subject: Formal Complaint Against Frontier Airlines for Repeated Flight Cancellations and Inadequate Compensation

Dear Office of Aviation Consumer Protection,

I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Frontier Airlines regarding a recent experience that I believe warrants your immediate attention and intervention.

On [Date of Incident], I was scheduled to fly with Frontier Airlines from Charlotte, North Carolina. I arrived at the airport at noon on Wednesday, only to be subjected to an ordeal lasting over 26 hours due to Frontier’s repeated delays and eventual cancellations of my flight. The details of this experience are as follows:

	1.	Repeated Cancellations and Delays: My original flight was delayed six times before it was ultimately canceled. I was rebooked on another flight later that night, which also faced multiple delays. The worst part occurred when passengers, including myself, were actually on the bridge to board the plane, only to be turned back at midnight due to yet another cancellation.
	2.	Inadequate Compensation: Despite being stranded at the airport overnight, Frontier provided me and other passengers with only a $5 food voucher. This voucher was grossly insufficient, as it could not even cover the cost of a basic meal or a bottle of water at the airport.
	3.	Lack of Assistance: Unlike other airlines that provide hotel accommodations and shuttle services in such situations, Frontier offered no such support, leaving many passengers to fend for themselves. Fortunately, I was able to find lodging with a friend, but many others were left scrambling to find a place to stay or were forced to sleep in the airport.
	4.	Incompetent and Uninformed Staff: The following morning, when I arrived at the airport for my rescheduled flight, the confusion and disorganization continued. For nearly two hours, the airport staff appeared to have no idea which flight was scheduled to depart next. At one point, the staff was asking passengers for information regarding the flight status.

After enduring this prolonged and frustrating experience, I finally departed from Charlotte at approximately 3:30 PM on Thursday, over 26 hours after my original scheduled departure. The total time I spent at the airport was a staggering 19 hours for what should have been a one-hour flight home.

Given the severity of this incident, I am requesting that the U.S. Department of Transportation take enforcement action against Frontier Airlines for their repeated cancellations, failure to provide adequate compensation, and the overall poor handling of the situation. It is unacceptable for an airline to treat its passengers with such disregard and to fail to meet basic customer service standards.

In accordance with applicable regulations, I respectfully request that your office acknowledge receipt of this complaint within 30 days and provide a written explanation of the actions taken, or to be taken, in response to this complaint within 60 days.

I would also appreciate any guidance you can provide on additional steps I can take to seek further recourse in this matter. Please advise if there are any other regulatory bodies or consumer protection agencies I should contact, or if there are other actions I can pursue to hold Frontier Airlines accountable for their actions.

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt response and to learning how the Department of Transportation plans to address this issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",klahr001,1,1eo9xp5,na

Up to then, it might have fully been bad luck, beyond Frontier's control, but as we taxi'd down the runway, a passenger noticed the emergency exit door had some piece of broken plastic hanging off of it (this was soon after the Alaska Airlined debacle)  We waited again.  This was their fault.   Just nasty vibes from the FLight Attendants.

Previously, airlines could make their own internal rules about when passengers should receive compensation for a flight delay. But the new Department of Transportation rules actually sets an industry-wide standard: Delays requiring compensation are defined as delays of more than three hours for domestic flights and more than six hours for international flights. This was recently passed in April of this year. ",Ok_Government_1943,1,1eo9xp5,na

li0nzac,2024-08-14 11:25:22,"I am a gate agent for frontier &amp; mentor other frontier agents, yes, it’s true we are penalized if we do not close doors 20 minutes prior to departure. We are told by frontier to not specially announce the time there is left during boarding calls…my announcement typically sounds like “This is a final boarding opportunity for this frontier airlines flight X all passengers are welcome to board,” followed by “Attention all passengers on this frontier airlines flight to Vegas. Your flight is fully boarded and doors are closing SHORTLY to make an on time departure.”


Yes we have less time to board even if the plane comes in late, they want the door closed to meet that time frame. So my best pro tip would be, try NOT to board last when flying with frontier!!!",Altruistic-Sand-1113,30,1erekdd,na
li1c5v8,2024-08-14 11:25:22,"Why is policy specifically not to give passengers the time until door close? 

I imagine the thought is to prevent people from hearing “one minute” and deciding that’s enough time for a bathroom run or to buy a sandwich. But if that causes them to miss a flight, shouldn’t that conclusively work to Frontier’s advantage? If/when a customer tries to argue?",Ok_Tiger5671,7,1erekdd,li0nzac
liaohnh,2024-08-14 11:25:22,This is roughly how every airline does it.  The 15 minute rule is standard and travelers should know that - the extra 5 minutes is weird but your announcement is sufficient and travelers just aren’t paying attention.  It’s really dumb for them not to be in the boarding area and ready by 20 minutes to departure (coming from another flight or some other related thing notwithstanding).  It’s like people are deliberately ignorant just so they can Karen out and inconvenience everyone.,One_Cartographer_254,2,1erekdd,li0nzac

I woke up at 130 alone and many of the lights turned off because the gates were closed.  My flight had already landed in Vegas by then.  

It was frontier and I was really pissed. At first they told me too bad.  After a bit of hell raising and almost 2 weeks they gave me multiple vouchers to cover the fight and the 60$ Uber ride to and from my home for the flight.  When I checked in for the flight I had shown the agent my message card and watched her make a note on some log. They sent her to another gate before takeoff.  I was able to get security to pull video which showed the agent looking at the card I handed her and make a note.

Still I had to raise hell with frontier before they finally caved.  They were complete asses. Still I fly with them. AA is 10x worse.

lhcy4sk,2024-08-10 07:43:06,"Filed small claims case against Frontier in Denver courthouse today for the same exact issue.    

They lured myself and 5 others off the plane mid trip with promise of a thousand dollars worth a free flights and a later flight to our destinations that day. 
But once off, reneged on the same day flight, turned the matter into an involuntary removal, refused accommodations and refused to actually show vouchers, their terms or provide cash.   

Later, they emailed a single voucher with a bunch of terms that render it virtually worthless.  My favorite part is if even one cent of the voucher is used, the remainder vaporizes.     I ended up having to purchase a very expensive Delta ticket to continue on, as their proposed solution was a 22 hour Odyssey the following day with stops.

Several passengers discussed repeatedly the multiple trips they planned to use the vouchers for with the agent and she merrily nodded and continued processing them.  

I understand the contract of carriage terms; but Airlines can and do often times negotiate above this baseline, and their behavior here, in my humble opinion is clearly fraudulent.    

The small claims court will almost certainly refer it to mediation and that’s fine.   Both sheriffs offices that I  traveled to today laughed when they saw the address to serve the papers to, apparently this happens a lot.   

It’s unfortunate the ULCC business model revolves around screwing its customers and hoping they don’t pursue the matter.    A complaint with the DOT was simply referred back to Frontier, whose customer service agent promptly sent an email advising me to pound sand.   I’m doing my best to keep it non-personal though.

lfcygwz,2024-07-28 10:26:46,"Law student with a passion for civil procedure here. You can almost certainly sue any airline in the state in which you live in small claims court. 

It comes down to something called “personal jurisdiction.” Basically, Frontier has “personally availed” itself of the benefits and protections of the state of (OP’s state) by advertising there, having their planes take off and land there, having employees based there, accepting bookings there, etc. Therefore, because a bunch of the state’s services and other tax resources are going towards benefitting the airline, the court system says, it’s fair for you (the airline) to be sued in this state; we have jurisdiction over you. 

As to the choice of law clause, it likely wouldn’t even come up at all in small claims court. State court itself is like the Wild West, and small claims is the epitome of that. Judges are often relying on the most basic black letter law, especially of contracts (which is essentially the same in every state). The good news for OP is, that type of law is much more straightforward and accessible, as well as on their side, if the facts are as they state (which I dont doubt they are).",Pure-Rope-1120,5,1edwbe6,lfa3gqm

Last trip was easy, and *only* a one hour delay on the return, which is the best I've ever experienced with them.

Trip before that, cancelled 1 hour before takeoff, *had* to be back that night. Would've costed about $800 if I didn't buy the insurance through my bank. 

Trip before *that*, cancelled the day before, didn't get the memo, only option was a different airline at $1200.

I am thoroughly sickened watching families have to step off the line at the gate desperately trying to rearrange their belongings so the ""personal items"" will fit in those stupid cubbies, under threat of $4/5/600 charges to convert ""personal item"" to ""carry-on"" only to then incur an additional ""agent assistance fee"" for the privilege of being publicly humiliated in their moment of panic at the hands of a frontier staff member who's trying to score an easy commission.

Everything about frontier is predatory, and borderline bait-and-switch.

kx4d6jy,2024-03-29 23:25:15,"I swear Frontier has someone coming in here to obfuscate and blame any time a person notes that Frontier is a ripoff.

The scam isn't that they're charging for bags. It's not even that they charge less for bags if you book them with your ticket than if you book them a day later, although that is unjustifiable other than for profit.

The scam is that they won't let you book bags at the counter.

Why is that a scam? Because they charge an online convenience fee. Which in itself makes no sense, because as others have pointed out, their costs are way lower if you book online rather than in person, but hey, we've accepted online convenience fees as a society. But because they charge that fee, there must be another way of vooking to get around it, or their advertised fares are lies. That other way of booking, which makes their fares technically accurate, is at the counter.

But what we now know is that you cannot have bags without paying the online convenience fee, because the counter ticket can't include them. You can skip the fee by booking in person, but that ticket won't have bags unless you cancel out the convenience fee savings by paying the arbitrarily higher post-booking baggage fee.

Their workaround is to capture as much or more on the luggage fees.  Same thing with seats.  On spirit same thing. so there’s little point in buying tickets at the counter unless u plan on not needing to buy extra shit.  Also the bundled seats, bags etc is a great deal on spirit because u can often get exit row, a bag, a carryon for a reasonable price.   Buying at the airport was better before these ULCC’s went absolutely nutty with the intensity of the fees such that the differential in bag and seat prices was not much different between online at time of purchase and later.

They found our luggage &amp; we picked it up on our way home. They charged us extra baggage fees &amp; overweight fees for the suitcase we had to buy because they lost ours.


On the way home after the luggage fiasco (which we didn't argue much over because I was tired &amp; the check in attendant seemed clueless as to how our lost luggage on the flight in had anything to do with the flight back.), we stopped for a meal in the airport. We each left the restaurant with a hot drink - I had earl grey tea &amp; he had a coffee drink. We get on the plane, the flight attendant saw my cup with lid &amp; tea bag labels &amp; told me I couldn't bring alcohol on the plane. I showed her my cup of tea, told her it was earl grey &amp; told her it wasn't alcoholic and then even said she could take it &amp; dump it if there was any concern. I just wanted to go home. Not good enough. She alerted the crew to my alcoholic beverage. Announcements re alcohol were made. We were being pointed out by the flight attendant,  literally pointed to &amp; talked about. I handed the tea to another flight attendant &amp; told her it was just tea, not worth the trouble. The 1st FA saw this &amp; stormed over &amp; stated barking orders about sitting down &amp; stowing luggage, which we had been in the process of doing. She literally blocked access to the overhead bin while she was telling us to stow our gear.


My husband is deaf. He has a Cochlear implant, but had the microphone portion unhooked &amp; put away. He couldn't hear her. I was trying to tell her this, while trying to catch his attention.. I finally grabbed him &amp; asked him to just sit down &amp; not make things worse, because he turned around to her just as she start raging that we had to sit down &amp; let people pass.  Then, because we were sitting in an exit row, she went over instructions &amp; asked everyone if they understood. My husband responded too quietly - his ears were ""unplugged"", which she already knew, he has trouble regulating his volume when he can't hear. (He reads lips, he knew what she had said.) She blew up &amp; literally yelled at every person in the exit row to speak up when it was their turn. Then she turned at sat facing us in her rear facing seat for takeoff. She scowled at us the entire flight.

The way the WH worded this makes it sound like there is going to be this bonanza of free flights because of delays. There is not. 

This auto-refund thing is actually problematic because what you are going to see is airlines cancelling reservations and refunding money when travelers would much rather be rebooked on the next flight 4 hours later because they need to get home and a new ticket is going to cost 3x as much.

Legislative rules like these are passed through the DOT/FAA rulemaking, not congress in the post *Chevron* world, so since 1984. Either way, if they did have the ability to stop them, they failed, because the rules were published on 4/26 and 4/30 respectively. They both go into effect on 6/24 and 7/1 respectively.

kymonze,2024-04-08 23:22:35,"so frontier does like 90% turns now, one delay can snowball into more delays. It happens. As a matter of fact I was trying to commute home one on American Airlines and it got delayed 5 times and 7 hours. It’s not just frontier but sure we’re easy to hate. Yesterday I was working a flight and there was a wind change at the airport. We had to circle for 20 minutes. Then JetBlue was at our assigned gate and we had to wait another 30 minutes. That caused an hour delay for us. Then the crew had to change and maintenance came on to check everything. The other day my friend was working a flight and there was a broken window seal so it was delayed 4 hours until it was fixed. Frontier only has like 140 planes in their fleet, compared to Americans like 1000. You understand the company has to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars for every delay and cancellation right? In fines and compensation? That the company doesn’t enjoy doing this? That the flight attendants like me hate it because we don’t get paid SHIT when there’s a delay until that door is closed? “You get what you pay for” is true fine, but people gotta learn that the attitude I have seen from passengers and how they treat us, especially when I’m not getting paid for boarding or when I’m waiting to get on the plane, makes everyone’s experience worse. I’ve had delays from passengers who dilly dally and walk to the back of the plane and then say “where’s seat 1F?” Which caused a 15 minute delay because we had to get a new clearance after waiting for the count. Yeah frontier should have a phone number to call, but the abuse the call center was receiving probably contributed to them removing the public access.",PaleontologistFar981,-1,1bymj8h,na

Actually show up to the airport early instead of 10 minutes before departure and yelling at gate agents because they legally close the doors 15 minutes before departure if there’s no delay/line of people. The amount of people who have yelled at ME for a delay and I’m like “I’m sorry. I’ve been here four hours and haven’t gotten paid a dime so I understand” is just too damn high.

You can reserve a flight THE DAY BEFORE the flight, not 24 hours. If we are concerned about seat availability, we stay up until midnight (12:01 am) to book a flight the next day and a half. I use it to see my elderly parents half the time. We vacation with the rest. I went to Costco near my parents and bought $50 of socks and underwear, $30 at Target got toiletries. I leave them there, no baggage, no baggage fee. 

Our situation is probably optimum to use Go Wild, but it works for us. We are sitting on a plane in Atlanta now, flying home to DEN. We decided on not the direct flight, because of friendlier schedule, and only a 90 min layover.",Fly7950,3,1849a0x,na

Out of Cleveland they’ve ended daily flights to Dallas, Cancun, and even Miami/Florida has been gutted. I’m not a princess, but there was plenty of demand for said routes. 

The other ax to grind is Frontier has been caught allegedly only reserving as little as 2-4 seats a flight for go wild pass holder, even if the flight is near empty.

If this was the European Union, they would be heavily fined for misrepresenting the pass. EU law is about the spirit of the commerce, not the loophole.

ltd3bcg,2024-10-24 00:20:32,"Beware of False Advertising by Frontier Airlines' Go Wild Pass



I’m writing to share my disappointing experience with Frontier Airlines regarding their Go Wild Pass, which I purchased under misleading pretense. As someone who regularly travels for business between Atlanta (ATL) and San Jose, Costa Rica (SJO), I was excited to hear about the Go Wild Pass, which I believed would help me save on travel costs. My company purchased this pass specifically to cover my frequent trips to San Jose.



However, after purchasing the pass, I discovered that Frontier had discontinued flights between Atlanta and San Jose without any prior notice. This route is critical for my business needs, and yet, when I reached out to Frontier for either a refund or to put my membership on hold until flights resume, my requests were repeatedly denied. Despite the fact that the Go Wild Pass serves no purpose for me without the ATL-SJO route, Frontier has refused to honor my request for a solution.



The Go Wild Pass was advertised as a way to book discounted flights, yet no disclaimer was made about their discontinuation of flights to San Jose. This is a clear case of false advertising, and I’m incredibly disappointed in how Frontier has handled this situation. The pass is useless to me without this route, and the lack of transparency and customer service has been a huge inconvenience for me both personally and professionally.



For anyone considering the Go Wild Pass—be careful! It’s unacceptable to trust an airline for services they advertise but fail to provide. I hope Frontier reconsiders its stance and treats its customers with the fairness and transparency they deserve.",Expensive_Eye_1675,1,1849a0x,na
kauwba4,2023-11-27 01:31:33,"100% agree. They block it from being used in most flights even if they are empty. It’s ridiculous! If you look up the price for the flights that you actually get to use it on, you might as well just buy the regular ticket because they’re like 20 bucks. And we still have to pay $15. And they keep cutting destinations. They cut a flight I used to use from San Diego to Atlanta and they no longer fly to Costa Rica. On top of them leaving LAX over a CEO pissing match. DO NOT BUY!

My question is - by and large, ARE there typically any flights even available in that 24 hour window?

kcnvigf,2023-12-09 23:36:14,"I think most of the hate comes from people who don’t understand how Frontier (and Spirit and Allegiant) work in terms of a la carte pricing.  People expect the sun, moon, and the starts for the base fare, and then get mad when they realize that IF the ability to choose a specific seat is important to then, they have to pay.  IF they want to check a bag, they have to pay.  IF they want more legroom, they have to pay.  You can find some great deals even with this pricing model but most people don’t get it, and then blame Frontier even though they should blame themselves for not researching what they are buying.

However, there have been some pretty egregious situations that have involved canceled flights, etc.  So in that instance, if they’ve been screwed over in that kind of way where they’ve been left stranded somewhere, I understand the hate.

In my own experience, I’ve never had a major problem with Frontier and I have flown them for YEARS, mostly for short hops to Phoenix, Vegas, San Diego, etc from Denver.  I think the worst thing that ever happened to me was that I had a 4-hour delay on a return from Phoenix one time and it was because of weather, so not really the fault of Frontier, as all of the flights from all of the airlines were delayed that day.",jph200,8,18e3vhq,kcn4tgn

Not to mention, due to the 9/11/01 needed security upgrades, that meant one checkpoint per satellite (which is where the gates are), so that can mean extremely long, and slow lines during peak operation. 

Philadelphia I think is anything but terrible compared to Newark. It's full of art and personality, never boring. And unlike Newark, all the gates are accessible via one checkpoint, which is why (in my experience) the lines move a lot quicker.

I was 6 hours early for the return to MCO.

They held me off to the exact last second of the 2 hours as I saw the attendant eating Doritos for the previous 2 hours doing ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING.

In the 4 hours prior, I saw but one plane that was going off.

So no, luggage would not stack up, pretty damn simple (oh, it's Frontier, nothing is simple).

For me, at work, I hate it when I have nothing to do, makes the day drag, and exposes you as replaceable.

So would it NOT make sense &amp; make their job easier, to get the bags and AVOID any line congestion and backup? 
No.. that makes too much sense, doesn't it? It may have stopped her from eating her Doritos. 

I was first in line, and I scanned the QR, FAILS!
Enter 6 digit code.. FAILS.

The next person scans QR, works.

I try the same thing right after him ( now #2 in line) again, both FAILS again.

The next person up QR fails, but the code works. 
I try again (now #3 in line), AGAIN both FAIL.

Now,  notice a pattern here, the delay of time, as now it is my 3rd time doing this already, if the QR had worked for all 3 of us, it would have been 1/4 of the time of which it was.
Now, if it was busy like it was at MCO when I left, creating more delay. Luckily, this flight was not that busy.

I now go up to the counter, and she asked me,

""Did I change my flight?""

No, I'm stupid, I just figured i would get here 6 hours early to hang out at the airport today.

(I only went up two times prior to try to get my bag taken so I could at least get something to eat, as I had not had lunch yet. You have to get through TSA first to do that.)

Of course I didn't change my flight, and here is my reservation, and here is my first delay notice from your airline sent to me over a half hour ago,  (first of 5 notices I got that night).
 

Then she says, 
""Well, I will have to charge you $25 FEE for the bag sticker fee."" 

""I said I don't think so.""

Your FN machines are clearly screwed up.

Thinking ability is not a requirement for this airline. I was also informed by one of the stewardess on the plane. Every single person you deal with prior to entering the plane, are contractors. Not Frontier Employees.
So, do they really give a shit?

More than likely, they have no clue how to handle any problem, no company policies (which are totally screwed up), or anything, except for trying to extort more money from you.

Zero ability to answer even the simplest question. 

Luckily, I had 3 others backing me up that saw it fail. I had previously told them the horror story of getting from MCO to CVG on Easter Sunday as we all waited.  She finally relents, and I move on (now#7 in line). TSA is a breeze even though I am pulled from line for a pat down, then of course my laptop had to be double checked after that, so an extra 10 minutes there.

Oh, am I loving this trip right. After the nightmare getting there.

As a final kick in the balls, yes there is more,  I go to get on the plane, says row 13F (lucky 13, it actually has extra leg room and doors to blow off if it was a Boeing plane). 
Nope, go to scan QR, FAILS AGAIN!! 

Now, the one at the counter didn't think to replace the failed QR on my phone, and that it didn't understand the 6 digit code with a boarding pass. 
(She was so busy ya know).

Nope, pulled aside, not till every single person is boarded did they get to me again.

The first person there, the last to board. Then get a ticket for row 40C. Yep, back off the bus. May as well have given me the toilet.
Yes, this was my lovely return flight after missing the first flight due to the 80-minute bag line. Then getting there instead at 730 am, but get there at 1am the next day. 

Think I will set foot on Frontier ever again?

Not a fucking chance.
You can't pay me enough.

The answer is that it’s cheap and works well enough for enough people. That’s it. Not complicated. Frontier, Spirit, and Avelo have allowed my family to take trips that would otherwise be out of our budget. We know the seats are hard and don’t recline but not reclining means no one reclines into us, we pack light and check the sizer before the gate, we bring snacks/drinks and charged electronics, and we are sometimes split up in our seating assignments. We know and expect this in exchange for the price.

Those $20, $30, and $40 one way fares become $80, $90, and $100 each way and that definitely makes a big difference. 

There are valid reasons to complain about Frontier but I feel like people like to pile on for stupid stuff too. I avoid most problems by never checking bags, never doing connecting flights, and using FlightAware to keep an eye on my flight for delays. I’ve had 1 cancelled flight which cost me one night at an AirBnB but over 3 years, that pretty damn good.

If it’s a physical voucher, they better be handing that to me right there.

Obviously different airline, but I don’t think it’s a stretch to assume it should have been done at the gate in your case instead of the wait and see you received.

There’s a protocol that should have been followed and unfortunately the gate agent didn’t seem to follow the proper protocol nor maintain correspondence with you guys or the specific frontier department which we send emails to back and forward. In a scenario like this, whenever I work an oversold flight I ensure to tell the passenger to stay in the gate area while I wrap up the flight and close the loading bridge door. I then make sure that the amount of passengers checked in matched the passengers who were boarded and then count one very last time before closing the aircraft door, to make sure there really aren’t any seats left… because if there was…. I would send any passengers waiting to fill in the open seats, board them, and then close out the flight on the computer and shut the aircraft door. 

Once that is complete, then the gate agent has to verify your personal details including email, phone, address to ensure that the voucher will be properly received. Without this information properly accounted for in the system, the vouchers will not be sent. The agent should also document the reservation. 

Sometimes there is a high volume of emails received. So getting compensated will usually take an hour if this is the case. But the agent shouldn’t wait to re accommodate you on the next available flight. They can do that and then take care of sending the proper email.

ksmao7r,2024-02-29 08:05:18,"I get it but let me add this.

All airline employees including flight attendants, gate and counter agents absolutely lovvee to escalate a negative encounter instead of deescalating it.

Know why they do this?

Because they hide behind the increased enforcement efforts of the FAA, FBI, US DOJ and US DOT knowing they're 'protected' and they use this to their advantage.

I'm actually thinking of using a bodycam going forward at all times from airport start to airport finish because I do not trust any of these employees at all. They can literally say you threatened them and who do you think has the leverage when the police arrive? The airport police will not conduct a proper investigation but instead will usually take the employee's word for what happened because most of these airline supervisor and managerial employees are 'friends' with airport police who almost never take the passengers side even when they're right.

It's not the job of law enforcement to mitigate business transactions but its also not the job of airline employees to intentionally have someone arrested because they can and they want to show you what happens when you disobey their 'orders'.

""Interference with a flight crew"" is so loosely written that it applies to almost any directive you're given. If you're told to stay seated but you can't hold your excrete and have to use the bathroom, technically, you just interfered with a flight crew and could be subject to arrest.

If I were an airport police officer I'd be the only one in uniform looking at what airline employees do encourage these reactions and I might move to arrest them for an act related to breach of the peace or disorderly conduct.

These employees need to understand law enforcement is not a tool at their disposal to intimidate, harass, and ruin the lives of travelers who are upset about a particular circumstance even if the airline is right about their policy and the customer is wrong.

When situations get out of control and the airport police are needed, absolutely they need to step in and their job but what the US DOT, US DOJ, FAA and FBI have done here is create a wild card action where they can say ""it was this guy"" and suddenly you're in handcuffs.

Airline employees are not always right and I have personally witnessed this both inflight and at the gate and counters. Some of them even try to provoke a physical reaction so they know you're going to jail and they do what they can to try and get one. Remember that when you watch these videos even if here the guy was out of control.",fuquber,-22,1b2l26c,na

I just returned from a trip that uses Panama City as a hub, and none of the departure videos in the airport worked, making it especially difficult to know any status changes.

kx81ucj,2024-03-30 14:58:46,"There are regulations that govern airline flights being oversold and how the airlines have to manage it. I used to work for United and because we had multiple San Francisco flights (so lots of rebooking due to delays and such) it wasn’t uncommon for a flight to be oversold. When you’re involuntarily bumped they have to reimburse you money- the longer it takes them to get you to your destination, the more money you get. I once watched as a guy that wasn’t anymore than 22 maybe, walk away with a check for $1500 because we were so backlogged due to cancellations and delays we couldn’t get him to his destination for a couple of days. He paid less than $500 for his ticket in the first place. Frontier owes you money!

Edit- I’m not sure how to work around their bs that they said you flew- whatever seat you had was used by someone else so two people can’t sit in the same seat for the same flight and it can be proven that you didn’t take their flight. Definitely save anything you have from the flight you did wind up taking.

Nobody else from that flight got one, they spent the night in the airport. Sad but true, you can sometimes actually raise your voice to these people if you know what you’re talking about.

I woke up to an email announcing an hour flight delay leaving SF- but when I checked the app- no mention of any delays, so I erred on the side of caution and got there in time for the original flight. Got to SFO, and the electronic departure boards have my flight as leaving on time.

But when I get to the gate- delayed an hour. It’s frustrating to get mixed messages about departure time. Whatever. 

Then in Phoenix, I flew on to Chicago. The plane was full, and FILTHY. I had to wipe crumbs from the previous passenger off my seat before I sat down. There was shmutz everywhere else- the plane wall, the mini tray table, and a piece of chewed gum where my feet went- which I had to avoid.

I get to the airport, check myself and my luggage in, everything seems normal. I’m in the lobby waiting to board for an hour and a half — that’s normal. The plan finally arrives and still, everything seems normal. They call the groups and we all begin to board.

As I am STEPPING ONTO THE PLANE, the make ALL of us turn around and go back to the waiting area of the airport. There’s some issue with the planes wheel. We get delayed an hour so they can have a mechanic come fix it. Then that delay turns into a SIX hour long delay. Not joking. My girlfriend, who flew out of another airport, was already in the sky by the time the delays started rolling in, so I had no way to tell her what was going on.

Eventually, the flight gets cancelled altogether. I wait in line for literally two hours to talk to the Frontier attendants and see what I could do. Apparently there were no other flights going to Las Vegas until the next morning. Cool. My flight wasn’t round trip, so I was out $500 from the flight I would’ve taken to return, because it was non-refundable and through a separate airline.

Worst of all, my girlfriend had already made it to Las Vegas. I had no way of telling her the flight had been completely cancelled until she had landed. She was bawling her eyes out and I was almost there too. She basically stayed inside of the AirBnB we booked the entire time she was there, because she didn’t want to do anything that we planned by herself.

All because they couldn’t get a SINGLE mechanic to come fix a wheel.",[deleted],1,1b7o6ke,na

When it’s frontier $100 and delta $125, I’d say at least 1/4 of Americans will just take the cheaper option without doing any research at all. 

I’ve flown a frontier $78 roundtrip (albeit with a stop) on a route only served by delta. Delta wanted $650. We can’t afford $650 x 5. We CAN afford $78 x 5. No question it’s worth it in that situation.

ls6rfyi,2024-10-16 19:55:54,"This can happen with any airline. 

I fly Frontier when I can go personal item only, don’t need a connection and don’t have any set place to be in case of delays since most of the flights I would take with them (or any other budget airline) only have one flight a day and only fly that route a few days a week.  Checked bags or carry on fees eat into the cost savings. 

Most of my flights are tied to other expenses like hotels or events I want to attend so typically the only time I fly budget airlines is to visit family when there isn’t a set time I need to be there or my job (or manager) will have issues if I’m delayed on my return.  

I stopped flying Frontier when I was working because any delays could cause a problem if I couldn’t get back to work as planned (personal item only meant my work laptop wouldn’t fit and I couldn’t nod my job with a tablet that I usually would bring). Now that I retired I recently flew them since I could deal with not going if the outbound flight was cancelled and I would extend my stay if the return one couldn’t be booked for a few days if if was delayed or cancelled.  

When flying any budget airline or even legacy carrier with limited flight schedules, you need to book with eyes open and think about what your plan B is if your trip is disrupted. The worst part of flying the budget airlines, in my opinion, is they won’t work with other airlines to get you a seat so you can stick to your itinerary better.",Retiring2023,0,1g4sbqg,na

My gut on this is that the flight was not oversold, given they were giving seats to standbys. The standbys wait at the gate, and when the final boarding call happens, seats are released to them, in order. What would make sense to me here, is that your ticket failed to be scanned when you boarded the plane at the gate. This could happen if you intentionally snuck by (unlikely), forgot to scan your boarding pass, or attempted to scan your pass but failed to confirm it was scanned successfully (eg it never beeped, or it beeped with an error). However it happened, while you were seated on the plane, the computer showed that you hadn't shown up. Final boarding call happens, your ticket is removed, the seat is freed up, and a standby is given your seat. The person who told you that you must have snuck on? Out of line. The person who got you back on the flight was able to catch and fix the mistake. The woman who got off the flight was likely a standby. One of the standbys had to get off to return your seat to you, and either she was the lowest ranked on the list, or was just the kind one who voluntarily gave up her seat for another standby to stay on. At the end of the day, the error was caught and fixed, hopefully without delaying the flight, and you only got compensated as a courtesy - although, I mean, it's almost better to send someone an acknowledgement/apology letter with no money, than it is to offer someone 10k miles. Like I'd rather have gotten free snacks and drinks on the flight than 10k miles. The gesture is just kinda cheap. Which, to be fair, is on brand.",Chonjae,3,1fg5vql,na

lmzvw32,2024-09-14 05:57:13,"&gt; Once a passenger has been accepted for boarding or has already boarded the flight, airlines are not permitted  to require that passenger deplane, unless the removal of the passenger is required by safety, security, or health reasons, or the removal is due to the passenger’s unlawful behavior.

No clue how that happened but you could make the case that someone not on the manifest being on the plane constituted a security risk so not sure they were totally in the wrong (or at least they could argue their case given the broad nature of that language). 

&gt; Before an airline forces a passenger to give up his/her seat due to overbooking, the airline must ask passengers on the flight if they are willing to give up their seat voluntarily in exchange for compensation.

Sounds like to me while you got off the plane they probably offered compensation for someone to volunteer to deplane and it happened to be the nice lady you sat next to considering you talked to her about why you were flying? 

&gt; Indeed, if I had violated FAA regulations, I could have faced tens of thousands of dollars in fines and possible prison time. This begs the question: If Frontier wants passengers to obey FAA regulations and be appropriately held responsible when they don’t, what is Frontier’s position when their employees violate FAA regulations?

Clearly you wouldn't have faced fines and/or prison time as you did nothing wrong if it had ever gotten to that point. Also as I've said above it's not clear the extent to which they may have well. 

&gt; To date I have been offered 10,000 miles on Frontier for this ordeal, which amounts to approximately a mere $20 off a future flight. 

Not sure where you got $20 from but they are worth more than that, not necessarily hundreds of dollars but you can get one-way tickets for as low as 2,500 that I've seen (although those are probably really only $20 flights).

I know I didn't violate FAA regulations, that's why I said ""if"". My point is that passengers are being held to higher standards than airline employees.

The cost of Frontier flights vary widely in money and points. I looked at the same flight from Philly to Orlando, and the flight was $59 or 30,000 miles. You seem to be equating the value of the miles to the best situations you have seen.

The airline knows that the attendants and gate agents are a meat shield that will soak up the ire of the customers, and yet the business model continues to be coming up with more “gotchas.”

The best example of this is the agent fee. “Oh, sure I can help answer this important and time sensitive question that you have, but you have to pay me $25 first.”

I spent years flying with frontier, figuring out what add-ons actually make a difference to my flying experience. The latest is that they stopped seating parties together.

In early 2014 my mom and sister bought their tickets to meet everyone in California months in advance for my Aunts wedding in June. Mom used to try and fly with them whenever possible. 

Between February and June Frontier changed their baggage policy, and when they arrived at the airport they were told they had to pay $50 each, each way, to check their suitcases. So an extra $200 out of nowhere. She was pissed. Tried telling them that wasn’t a requirement when they bought the tickets, and she was given no communication about the changes made in the meantime.

On the return leg, we got to the airport, checked in, and went to the gate. The flight kept getting delayed for reasons I can’t remember now. I checked with the agent at the front a few times who said she didn’t have any additional information. I asked if the flight would be canceled and she said she wasn’t sure. They decided to gift everyone a $5 Chick-Fil-A gift card for their inconvenience. While they were handing them out, I saw the pilot. I point blank asked him what was happening and if the flight would be canceled and he responded that there is no way this flight is taking off today. My wife and I own an optometry practice and she had to be at work the next day to see patients. I work at my own job as well, but can take off of work. She can’t since she’s the only doctor. I found tickets back home on Jet Blue which were at twice the price of our return flight (so basically the cost of our original round trip tickets), so I booked them and got Spirit to refund me the cost of our return tickets. We board the Jet Blue flight and I check the status of the Spirit flight we canceled and see that it had departed. I was heated. I contacted Spirit when we got back home and even escalated a complaint about bad info that we were given, but of course they wouldn’t do a damn thing about it.

They in essence added a 17-hour layover! Absolutely no phone number for customer service. Poor reservation person in India, stated the no-refund policy and hung-up.

k0heoeg,2023-09-14 08:15:56,"So many people apparantly never read the complaints from people who waited hours in line to unsuccessfully check a bag with Frontier. The same complaints show up multiple times a week. I would never risk trying to do that.

 I always advise family members not to bother with checking a bag when flying Frontier. They don't always listen. Maybe it depends on the airport and the day of the week. On Wednesday August 9th, I took family who insisted on checking a bag to Orlando airport. We used a kiosk to print a luggage tag and there were only 2 customers in line ahead of us checking luggage with Frontier and we were done in less than 5 minutes. Even the TSA lines were only about 10 minutes. I know it wasn't a typical day there.

On Saturday August 5th, I flew into Orlando with only a personal item and noticed that the whole airport was insanely busy with long lines everywhere. I doubt anyone would have had an easy time checking a bag and making their flight that day.

If you read the many complaints and still want to risk trying to check a bag that's on you. If you never read any other complaints about checking a bag at least now you know better. I always manage to make due with a properly sized personal item and the flight I take most often is under 100 bucks round trip. The plane is always full so lots of others also manage to figure out how to make the cheap tickets work for them.",GoingToTryAgain2,3,16i1b5q,na

If the app or website malfunctions (which happens a lot) I take screenshots as proof that I could not have made the check-in or change myself

I have also learned to check Flight Aware or other 3rd party apps to learn about delays. Frontier's app once let me buy a ticket that their app said was leaving in 4 hours, but FlightAware already knew based on the public FAA data that it was delayed 10 hours after that.

i'd be curious to know if the ULCCs are actually overbooking to a higher degree than the legacy carriers or budget carriers leading to a higher probability of bumping.

something else i've noticed anecdotally is a legacy carrier might fly the same route 3x per day 7x days per week vs with the ULCCs it's often more like 2x per day 3x days per week (so there are less options to be rebooked too), potentially exacerbating the bumping problem further.",tedmiston,1,1anp445,kpu0tvf

kuk3w30,2024-03-13 02:28:24,"Currently in Miami and got the Frontier pass ($299 for unlimited flights but still need to pay for taxes and fees) and flew a few times last year. I went to Chicago and Philly for the day, I would fly out in the morning and return at night. Around $30 roundtrip. (Even with the price of the flight and Ubers I still saved money versus a raging night in Miami 🥲). But I also used Frontier for flights to NY and Phoenix and stayed a few days with friends. I totally knew what I was getting into - I made sure my bag fit the requirements and I gambled on seating. Luckily I always got a window or aisle seat. I also flew with my partner and we were never seated next to each other which wasn’t an issue for us. The worse experience was getting delayed by 2 hours which can happen on any airline. 

I also had a friend from the NY area who came to visit for a week. Instead of dealing with the potential bag issue she opted to just bring her purse and used usps flat rate and mailed all the clothes she planned to wear while she was Miami. 

Bottom line is I saved a ton of money and was able to visit a lot of cool places. If you’re realistic about what you’re getting into and plan appropriately it’s all a really good deal.",PretendRanger,6,1bcyke9,na

But for those who think the $100+ difference in Frontier and Delta is just corporate greed, you are fooling yourself. Delta's employee training, technology, spare planes, bigger network, etc. are all in that fare difference. That might not matter to you generally or on this specific trip.

But the norm is just regular flying.

And with budget airlines, you will be paying for anything and everything. I don’t pick my seats. I only take a personal item. I don’t do priority boarding. I just let the cards fall where they may. Major airlines are also guilty of delays and cancellations for a myriad of reasons. What Frontier won’t do that they will do is simply be as accommodating during your customer service call. Frontier has more limited flight numbers so they can only accommodate so much.

As such if we choose frontier for the pricing vs schedule, we need to plan accordingly earlier than when something happens i.e. plan to pay more on another airline if it is important to get to the destination or it is time sensitive OR just pay more to fly an airline with more frequent flights to our destinations for situations like this.

lepuwv6,2024-07-24 23:04:21,"Cake to the OP (if I had any). And the Frontier fanboys here can go fuck off. According to the Washington Post, Frontier is the only airline that won't provide hotel accommodation and transportation in the case of significant delays. My fun trip:

LAS-DEN return on Frontier, 7/7/24

1:00 on-time departure

1:30 return to gate due to AC malfunction

3:00 reboarding after maintenance

3:30 reboarding halted due to weather delay

5:00 reboarding completed

5:30 returning to gate due to AC malfunction

6:15 ground crew finally available for deboarding

6:30 passengers surging to get off, pilot announces that “if it’s any consolation the temperature on the flight deck is 95,” a man rushes from the back of the plane saying he may be having a heart attack, cabin crew clearly not in control, announcement made that there would be four paramedic teams at the gate.

7:00 all passengers off, Frontier announces it will be getting a new aircraft, stand-by

At that point I feel sick as a dog. Turns out I caught a dose of covid (likely in a theatre). I leave the gate area to go to the Frontier assistance desk. It’s been announced that the flight will now depart at 6am the next morning. I’m too sick for that. Frontier can’t get me on a different flight until 10pm the next day, which would then strand me in Denver awaiting a shuttle home. Frontier can’t get me on another airline. So I book a $500 one-way on Southwest at noon, check into the nearest hotel ($250), sleep for 12 hours and make it home the next evening. Throw in food and taxis, bill came to $1000.

Complained to Frontier and received $220 of the $300 original ticket price, AND a $75 travel voucher … on Frontier. The message they sent was full of their legal terms, stating that they are not required to cover hotel or other airlines.

Make a DOT complaint about the chemical exposure and for lying about hotel vouchers  

https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/complaint-process  Frontier is the only airline that doesn't provide them.. but they are legally bound to promises they make. It's them being shady.. they can just claim agents were uninformed and avoid fines since they commit only to rebooking/meal vouchers. They know agents lie from complaints but do not care.

(Of course there are scenarios that there are odd number of UpFront plus passengers and then F9 get only $49 for that one middle seat)

I guess that $98 should be enough to cover the middle seat?

IMO that's a genius move as they create a business class without making any physical change to the planes, and avoid problems like empty seats in business but overbooked in econ. They just have the system to assign these passengers to the front and assign a non-existent John Doe between them, so it is completely flexible.",bc057,3,1bdbjyu,na

People say it’s our fault bc we’re cheap but a lot of times there’s also cheap passengers who have no respect for others and break out stuff bc “it’s cheap so they can do what they want”. I had this happen on an AMERICAN AIRLINES flight out of DFW (their main hub) while I was deadheading. It’s not limited to frontier!

kk5lxc6,2024-01-30 01:30:33,"Bingo.  There are like Six Commandments when it comes to Frontier.  

1) Direct nonstops only; never book any ticket with a layover ever.  

2) If you’re booking a flight because you have to be somewhere on a specific day/time, fly a day early.  You can’t chance missing a cruise or funeral because it’s Frontier after all.  

3) Personal Item sizes are sacrosanct.  0.01” over and you’re paying $100 at the gate. 

4) Carryons only.  

5) If you’re neglecting #4 and have to check a bag, get to the airport 3 hours early when checking a bag.  Anything less and you risk missing your flight because of that bag.  

6) Unless you’re paying for seats, you’re not sitting next to anyone on your reservation.  ",Kooky_Most8619,5,1ae0maz,kk4qrwk

kwnzp9t,2024-03-27 00:40:20,It really depends on the stations situation but I’d say it’s a combination of both. It was originally an idea I remember being brought up during one of the manager meetings from higher ups. If your city if falling behind on the quota then start charging carryons that don’t fit in the carry on sizer or if they have 3 bags and check it below the plane but even stations that are well over their quota might push this still just to make more on the commission. Unfortunately for cities where frontier doesn’t have a lot of flights those commissions pays majority of people’s bills and a lot of agents solely rely on that commission to make ends meet. Not saying that makes it okay but from my experience this is why it’s pushed so hard by the agents themselves.,Character-Ad8298,11,1bo8x80,kwnwyxp

This was responded to and a few days later I received an email asking for more information, including the flight number which I imagine was on the confirmation email that didn't show. 

That was seven days ago. 

I've politely asked if there was any resolution and it's been radio silence. Since there is no phone access and the company doesn't really care if you fly or not, what recourse is there? Has anyone tried denying the charges to the credit card company? 

Any help would be appreciated, I can't afford to lose my vacay time.

This is how Frontier works. The Flight crew and attendants aren't lying when they say you will get a refund because they think that's fair under the circumstances and how it will work.

But they aren't the ones who can give a refund.. that's customer service specifically designed to delay and deny. Think trying to cancel Sirius radio or cable.. their job is not to let you claw back money. So, they deny your claim without proof or offer worthless vouchers.. sometimes they just disconnect until you give up.

make a dot complaint:  

https://secure.dot.gov/air-travel-complaint  


Fill out a request form with all the same information:  

https://frontiercswprod.powerappsportals.com/contact-us/request-refund/  

When they receive the DOT complaint which they legally have to respond to, a different dept might cut you a check.. the issue might be proof... it's not like you recorded someone in your seats, or got a signed form from the flight attendant. Good luck.

First, accomodation for a passenger with a disability trumps everything except class of service (a disabled passenger is not entitled to a first or business class seat because it would be beneficial for their disability). However, they can absolutely be placed in a seat in their same class of service over the preference of the person who was assigned that seat based in a hirearchy list of need (for instance someone with a fused or immobilized leg gets top billing). 

Any charges paid for that seat by the person seating there should obviously be refunded. It gets complicated because these changes are often not on the record. As a flight attendant I would make these changes as passengers borded, explain why I had to (legally) do it and, well that was all I could do.

Don’t give up on flying though, it’s a great way to travel!

kybkc36,2024-04-06 21:40:50,"I keep track of the plane I'm supposed to board by using flightaware.com no matter which airline I'm booked on. You can often anticipate problems before any of the counter people or the displays at the airport are updated with correct information. Just a good habit to get into for your peace of mind even when things work just the way they are supposed to.

Checking bags with Frontier in Orlando is always a gamble. I personally would never risk it, but I've gone there with relatives who insisted they had to do it. Luckily, the day I took them there was no line and we used the kiosk to print out their luggage tags before we got in line. Unfortunately, if there is a line, most of the people ahead of you usually don't have their luggage weighed or tags printed before getting in line and it takes much longer to reach the counter.

 Always assume that holidays or weekends will have much longer lines for everything especially in a busy airport like Orlando. I've seen TSA lines go far down the hallway with way over hour waits at Orlando. I've also seen under 10 minute TSA wait times there on less busy times during the week.",GoingToTryAgain2,8,1bx9zv4,na
kyhkcpn,2024-04-06 21:40:50,"I LOVE Flightaware! Best feature is the tiny “where is my aircraft now?” Link. Many times I’ve seen that my flight showed on time, but my plane was 2 hours behind schedule and had two cities to visit before it lands at the airport where I am. A handful of times they’ve reassigned a new plane to come to our airport (mostly seen this on Southwest) instead of the one stuck on a ground stop in Chicago in a winter storm deicing back up or massively delayed in Denver due to cross winds. But once again Flightaware knows this before the gate agent or the Southwest app does! 

My whole family thinks I’m like some travel oracle because I know how to use FA. They will text me from the airport “my flight should have boarded 45 mins ago. Weather is perfect, gate agent is saying nothing. What’s going on?” And boom I can tell them that their plane is 1.5 hours behind schedule, they will miss their connection, they need to get on the phone NOW with their airline and to ask to switch to X flight and Y connection at Z time through A airport and in the meantime start walking their butt over to the new gate for their new flight. All through Flightaware and Google. From my couch. 😂 I’ve showed them how to use it but I just think novice travelers panic when there’s a little bump in the travel logistics and just hope and pray and wait. And trust that the only choice is to get in line with 150 other people and wait until a gate agent, helping them one at a time, can rebook them on the next flight on the same exact route (mistake… look for other routes!). 

I traveled 75% of my job for 10 years. I don’t hope and pray and wait. I gather all the info I can. I stalk my plane starting 5-6 hours before the flight. As soon as I sense an issue, I get on the phone with customer service. On a day with bad weather and delays in many cities where all the flights are effed, I will get on the phone with the airline and wait on hold with an AirPod in while researching my alternate routes WHILE physically standing in line for the gate agent’s help. If I get through on the phone, I stay in line because sometimes the phone person can rebook your flight but you need the person in the airport to move a checked bag or give you a voucher or whatever.  I tell them what I want, my plan A. The plan A is choosing an alternate airport that is out of the weather chaos. If it’s an east coast storm, yes let’s take the much less direct route through Dallas instead because going through DC is guaranteeing me further delays. If it’s in the Midwest, I’m not touching Chicago!!! Atlanta (an airport I HATE) looks lovely and very far from the Midwest/mountain states and their weather mayhem! 

When I get through I say “there’s this flight out of this gate through a completely different connecting airport on flight A. Can you put me on it?” If the answer is no that it’s full, we move to plan B. Also an alternate route usually. The faster you can move on days like that, running through the options you’ve lined up, the better your chances of getting where you are trying to go because open seats book up FAST when there’s mass cancellations/delays. The time it takes the person on the phone to do the searching for options you could have done yourself on Google while you are in line and on hold is the difference between getting there really late tonight (the IDEAL case on a massive weather event day!) or in 2 days.

Obviously stick to the same airline when you are researching options. If you are desperate and they have partner airlines (like Star Alliance) you can venture into those. Once again, Google to find out if you don’t know. Google weather maps of the country to see where the weather is nice. Then Google those airports and look at their flights to see how they’re doing (you can also look up airports on Flightaware to see their status and if delays are increasing or decreasing) to make sure you are picking connecting airports that are functioning on time and not dealing with their own delays for a separate reasons when there is no weather over them (New York airports, I’m looking at you!)

If you fly Frontier, Allegiant, and Spirit, you get what you pay for. I see people say “NEVER FLY FRONTIER!” On here but there are reasons to take these airlines that completely justify the gamble and poor treatment. For instance, that’s the ONLY way you can afford the trip. Or the logistics make any other scenario stupid… a direct flight on frontier in the winter is likely worth the gamble of a delay compared to a flight on Delta connecting through the Midwest or mountain states or even northeast where a winter storm, severe cold, high winds, etc are very common and introduce their own huge risk of delays/cancellations. Another example: my family uses Allegiant a lot to fly to a small airport in FL that is literally the ONLY airline that flies to that airport. Only Allegiant. The next closest airport is 45 mins further from my parents house. It has a direct flight for 2 of my siblings, one who has 2 kids under 3. And it’s half the price of any other airline. For them it is absolutely worth the risk compared to paying double to have a connection which adds risk with 2 littles of a delay,  AND a much further drive on what is already a long travel day for an infant and a toddler… and their exhausted parents. My relatives also use Allegiant into that tiny airport because there are sub-$100 direct flights from my mom’s hometown in the northeast and her elderly relatives really need direct flights at their age and health. Plus cheap, close drive, direct flight.

kycrdwb,2024-04-07 02:06:00,"You got to the airport 90 minutes before your flight time and 45 minutes before your flight starts boarding. The thing is, you have bags to check and Frontier has a rule that you need to check your bags 60 minutes before the original flight time.

So you had 30 minutes to get through the line of 300+ people as you said. It is Frontier’s fault for not staffing their counters properly so the line should t be that long especially at MCO which is one of their hubs. Especially in the early morning when they have a bunch of flights and everyone arrives at the same time since it’s early morning so it’s the “morning rush”.

What happened is when you got to the front of the line to check your bags, it was less than 60 minutes before the flight time so they couldn’t check your bags and this said you didn’t make it forcing you to buy different tickets for a later flight so that you can check your luggage in time.

Frontier 100% sucks in terms of their checked bag system and this is one of the major reasons why. I only fly Frontier when I don’t check bags. If I check bags, I’ll be flying a different airline or will take extra precautions to get there super early to make sure I’m at the front of the line between 60 and 120 minutes before flight time. 

This is even if the flight is delayed. They don’t extend the bag check window due to a delayed flight. They plan to have all the bags checked and through the airport to wherever they stage them for loading by the original flight time even if the flight is delayed.",droplivefred,5,1bx9zv4,na

Don't do that.

 I fly with no carry on. If you think I didn't look for every possible explanation other than ""he stole it"", you're mistaken.

&gt;Flight attendants do not make announcements

The Frontier staff at the check-in counter called to the gate.

The gate said flght attendant ""Harry"" left the plane, with the power bank in hand, and either had the gate make an announcement, or made the announcement himself, then left with the item in hand.

The Frontier staff at the check-in, verbatim, said ""He stole your power bank"", as did the people at the gate (which I heard over the phone call).

&gt;If you were close enough to your seat that you could see the charger, I am sure you could have made it to your seat even during the turbulence.

Sure, maybe I could've. Doesn't change the fact that my property shouldn't've been stolen.

&gt;It's not an ethical practice to accuse someone of stealing till you have solid evidence.

A Frontier staff literally said he stole it.

There is no other justification. A passenger returned the item to him -&gt; I asked that specific flight attendant -&gt; he said he hadn't seen it and that nobody brought one to him.

The only possibility is that the old woman lied to me about returning it, but the gate, and Frontier staff, determined that the FA did indeed have the power bank at some point.",lesbiyond,5,16zufnm,k3gzz75
