ksdvltl,2024-02-27 23:18:29,"Not sure if this helps, but after some years of trying different angles - this is how I do it now:

FC pricing and point redemption varies wildly if booked directly online.  However, upgrading Main Cabin is always 25,000 miles each way per seat.

So for two tickets I find my desired flight and FC availability (must have open lay down seats).  

IMPORTANT STEP: Contact HA by phone and let them know the flights and ask if FC upgrades are available for those flights at 25,000 miles.  Once they confirm, book the MC seats with them still on the phone and provide them confirmation code.  They will do the upgrade while your on the phone.

Bottom line is two round trips FC for MC fare plus 100,000.  

Maybe this works for you?  For us it always takes away the wondering about fluctuations in pricing and point redemption.  It's just always 25,000 no matter what the pricing is doing on the HA web site.

Hope this helps.",PoieWoie,2,1b1ce8o,na

kr3oz89,2024-02-19 14:03:42,"Just an FYI of what I‚Äôve noticed regarding SEA-OGG route.

I believe they fly their A330 (big one, lie flat FC) seasonally, and otherwise fly their A321neo (smaller one, normal recliner FC).

My educated guess is a combination of demand AND the jet stream. I think the jet stream is predictably a stronger headwind in a certain direction during certain times of the year, thus need bigger plane more fuel to make the whole flight without having to stop to refuel in like LAX or something. When the winds are favorable, the smaller plane can make it no problem.

‚ÄúWe'll do our best to seat children under age 14 with an accompanying family member. Select your own seats as far in advance as possible by logging in to My Trips. If no suitable seats are available online, let our agents know when you get to the airport, and they'll do their best to reseat you.

Finally, if your child is booked under a separate confirmation code, our system won't know that they're part of your group. In that case, please call our Reservations Department to have their reservation linked with yours.‚Äù

With regard to whether you can get anything refunded because you get seated separated, I highly doubt it. It‚Äôs better to think of buying a Main fare as buying a ticket that can be changed, and yes, you can select your seat.

ljnt5fi,2024-08-24 12:49:05,"Flew from Haneda to Honolulu maybe a month ago. If you get there super early the Hawaiian Airlines desk won't even be open; that said, the airport has plenty to check out and keep you occupied. If, for example, you have someone in your ohana that was really hoping for canned bread, there's a flight-centric gift shop in there that has some. Otherwise it's kind of hard to find. Anyway, there's a full-up shopping mall, and as long as you don't have too many bags to tote around it won't be a problem. Good time to use up any last credit on your welcome Suica card.

Pay attention to when the check-in does start. You want to get in line before that happens. The line will get huge, and wrap twice around the desk; it moves, it just takes forever. You might as well be one of those people that gets through the line quickly and then has extra time once you get through security. Otherwise, you'll get through security, walk super far to the gate, and have maybe half an hour before it's time to board. Either way you aren't likely to be cruising the pre-security area without having to deal with your bags.

Pay attention to which line you get into at the check-in desk. They will be marked with the flight number; getting into the wrong line won't help you, because it won't be moving.",lanclos,5,1ezupqs,na

If you were flying from the airline‚Äôs hub you could check in that early (but HNL is not a great airport for a long layover), but at an airport where the airline only has one or two flights per day, the ticket counter won‚Äôt normally open until 3 hours before departure, which Hawaiian Airlines advises is the case for Haneda. So if you are hoping to check your bags early and do things in the airport, that likely won‚Äôt be possible.

And just the other day they offered to give us two $400 vouchers but has to be used up within the year while we hadn't planned on going back to Hawaii. So now what do we do? I then asked him we're not going back to Hawaii next year, he said well you could just transfer them to somebody else, I said this is unacceptable, can't you make these a couple years before they expire they won't give me a response.

# Starlink In-flight Wi-Fi

When you fly with Hawaiian Airlines, you‚Äôre invited to experience our authentic Hawaiian hospitality and enjoy all the comforts of home. Starlink internet is now available on all our A321neo aircraft between Hawaii and the Continental U.S., giving you easy access to high-speed Wi-Fi on select flights to the Continental US and Cook Islands ‚Äî free of charge. We expect this service to be available on all of our A330 aircraft by the end of 2024.

llmjy8a,2024-09-05 21:28:46,"&gt; do their own itinerary and do Hawaiian air and transfer to a difffent airline to get to Europe?

Yes, sort of. But it‚Äôs not a good idea. I have family in the Bay Area, so when I have gone to Europe so far this year, I‚Äôve flown Hawaiian HNL-SFO, then spent a few days with family, before flying United SFO-Europe. This only makes sense because I want to spend time in SFO.

The Hawaiian flight + the United flight is much more expensive than if I had booked from HNL to Europe on a single ticket with United.

Next year I‚Äôm going to Spain, by fling Hawaiian to JFK and then AA from there. This only made sense because I had an award ticket on AA. But to feel comfortable doing this, I‚Äôm landing at JFK 28 hours before my flight to Spain, and staying in the hotel at JFK for a night.

Doing your own itinerary really only works if you can be very flexible. If book Hawaiian to the mainland, and then a different carrier to Europe, and your Hawaiian flight gets delayed or cancelled, you will miss your Europe flight and they won‚Äôt put you on the next one because you no-showed. You also have to leave security, pick up your bags, and then check them again. No interline on a different tickets.",ChequeOneTwoThree,6,1f9gjy3,na

l8yb11j,2024-06-17 11:29:07,"Traveling 2nd week of January through February is a good timeframe to get lower fares due to the low season. Like others have said 35K round trip, per person is the lowest you will see, so snag it if you see it.

Considering that SAN/OGG only has 1 daily direct flight, you may not see big reductions in fares until you get closer. My ultimate suggestion is to make sure you are signed up for Hawaiian‚Äôs marketing emails. Chances of your particular route being on sale is low, BUT it gives a good indication of what travel periods they are currently advertising for and can prompt you to check your flights. Setting up alerts on Google flights is a good option too. It won‚Äôt track mileage rates only $, but a good way to keep an eye on fares since cash fares and mileage fares kind of follow the same pattern.

I would say that flights during this period usually don‚Äôt start getting promoted until, maybe around October, but for sure not before Summer ends. Right now they are promoting fall travel, so can kind of do the math. If you like to take your chances, you could wait to see if they do a Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale, but if nothing happens by that point, I don‚Äôt think much will change after that.

Another consideration is to see if there‚Äôs any savings on making one of your flights connecting through HNL. Yes, it adds like 2 more hours or travel, but sometimes the savings in miles might be worth it.

Regarding a points calendar: idk if a 3rd party website that does this, but many of us who book often with Hawaiian got annoyed when they rolled out their new reservation system and did away with the low fare calendar. üòë Best you can see now is across the same week that you are booking, but nothing much more than that, which is lame.",Temporary_Cow_2340,4,1dhk0t2,na

I would recommend Oahu for a first time visiter with kids. While I think Kauai is the most beautiful of the islands, there are more varied experiences here and Kauai north shore in December is often rainy. 

By the way, last week in December in any year is an expensive week and availability will be limited.  We used to rent out our condo to vacationers and the last two weeks of December were the hottest weeks. 

Depending on budget and ages of kids and your interests you might choose among Waikiki (most popular), Ko Olina (westside multi-resort development built around four man made lagoons), and Turtle Bay (single luxury resort, north shore). 

I‚Äôd recommend considering Ko Olina in particular because you might be able to snag a 2 or 3 BR unit with kitchen on a beautiful beach by searching Beach Villas at Ko Olina or Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club on VRBO or similar search sites.",Rare-Oil-6550,6,1g8w929,na

just like Rainier or N Cascades, nature does not care how risky you want to be 

however be advised the swimming in waikiki is not much fun, the only sandy area is in front of the sheraton/royal hawaiian, everywhere else is rocks and dead coral underfoot, good for learning to surf though

west side ko olina is better for resort ish vibe and beach/water but it can be very pricey, pricey even for HI, also there's not much else out there and it's a trek to get anywhere else on the island due to traffic, rush hour to the west side or leeward is soul sucking",bulldogsm,3,1g8w929,na

lt1ls94,2024-10-22 02:17:58,"Probably not the right sub for this, as there are ones dedicated to visiting Hawai'i and specific islands. That said, it depends what you want to do. O'ahu is a good mix of urban environments with plenty of shopping and dining options at all price points, along with accessible, enjoyable outdoor activities. 

Maui is definitely very expensive, especially when you consider that it's currently better to stay in Wailea. Lahaina/Ka'anapali area is still a shadow of its formers self as the area continues to rebuild after the wildfires. Even though the resorts and their restaurants have reopened, many of the less expensive, better mom &amp; pop options remain shuttered. However, Maui is home to HaleakalƒÅ, which is a very interesting place to visit. It's also the second most urbanized of the islands. 

Kaua'i is often great for people that want to do a lot of outdoor activities (hiking the NƒÅ Pali coast) or just lounge around the resort. It's often described by visitors as one of the more laidback of the islands, though it's the smallest of the main Hawaiian Islands. 

The Big Island has a lot of large, nice resorts on the West side of the island, though there isn't much to do there unless you're willing to drive out 1-3 hours to other parts of the island. The East side of the island is home to just two large hotels, both of which aren't all that great in terms of quality. Again, if you're willing to drive and want to do outdoor activities, there are tons to do from Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, to zip lining over a waterfall, exploring a green sand beach, etc. The Big Island also has one of the most interesting food scenes around if you know where to look.",Kyo46,2,1g8w929,na

From there you can calculate if the time it takes to earn the miles you‚Äôd want for the routes you want and see if the annual fee is worth it. 

If it would take you more than a year, or the number is below 2,000 miles a month, id consider options like using the BOH HA debit card instead. $3 a month, but can you could still earn miles (it‚Äôs capped at 1,000 miles a month) but again all of this depends on your purchase power and the HA credit card weighed against the other CCs in your wallet.",izzymatic,1,1fqslcb,na

I like Alaska Airlines but, something like this is bound to happen eventually if the DOT approves the merger. Just take a look at what happened with Virgin America. There are less nonstops in SFO, LAX and SAN on Alaska because they decided to consolidate everything in Seattle instead.

This time around it is for growth, since organic growth is basically impossible due to aircraft deliveries.

Interisland flying may be on the chopping block and I‚Äôll bet dollars to do its that was one of the DOJs big concerns.

Alaska and Hawaiian are merging mileage programs next year. If you are able, just start getting credit cards to load up on Alaska and Hawaiian miles, and they‚Äôll combine next year.

A different arbitrage you can do, Alaska basic fares earn 30% miles towards status, while Hawaiian earn 100%. So it‚Äôs possible to earn Hawaiian status buying very cheap fares. I estimate $1300 for 4x RT tickets HNL-SFO, and that gets you status.

Because Hawaiian is a destination airline, much of the program is aimed at people who come to hawaii on vacation every year. If you live here, and can fly Hawaiian a few times between the mainland each year, you can get status, where you would need to fly 3x more, or purchase more expensive tickets, with Alaska.

What i learnt is the best usage is to fly to hawaii, mexico, bermuda, basically long haul flights at peak season. We just bought SEA-CUN for new year 2025 trip and that flight would have cost us $800 per person. After using companion cert, the second person only pays $267. So after factoring the annual credit card fees, we are still up $500+

There are some years where we can‚Äôt maximize the companion cert value. So we typically use it for a short haul flights such as SEA-LAX or SEA-LAS. Normally we barely breakeven after factoring the annual card fees, but we just shrug it off. It just means we havent maximized the companion pass value.¬†

Regardless, the whistleblower said that what they claim may lead to problems as the planes reach old age. The Hawaiian 787 are brand new. This same type of plane has flown for quite a few years with quite a few airlines. I don‚Äôt think you need to be worried.

It‚Äôs not just problems when the plane reaches old age - he‚Äôs flagging issues in the manufacturing process. It‚Äôs actually the exact same issue that the FAA forced Boeing to halt deliveries of the 787 in 2021 until they addressed. Essentially the whistleblower (again Sam Salehpour) is saying they never really fixed the problem or went back to the same bad process (I‚Äôm not clear on which from the reports). 

So to be clear - this isn‚Äôt an anonymous whistleblower. He‚Äôs not flagging an issue that Boeing hadn‚Äôt already admitted to. He‚Äôs flagging that they never really addressed the problem but did enough in 2021 to convince the FAA and then went back to the old/bad way. 

Bottom line - Boeing doesn‚Äôt have an issue in the design in most of its planes (except the max, the design is horrible). They have an issue in with their manufacturing process at the moment. There was nothing wrong in the design of the max‚Äôs doors - there was an issue in that manufacturing wasn‚Äôt done correctly.

*""He also claimed that tests on emergency oxygen systems due to be fitted to the 787 showed a failure rate of 25%, meaning that one in four could fail to deploy in a real-life emergency.*

*Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken.*¬†

*Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.*

*It established that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.""*

My best guess of what happened on April 6 (which arrived the night of April 5) is that the plane required maintenance upon arrival in PDX which caused it to fly out late on April 7 instead so it could be repaired. Being that PDX is not a Hawaiian hub, contracting maintenance might have been more difficult. Also, since it‚Äôs not a hub, there‚Äôs no extra aircraft to switch out, resulting in long delays.

I then mentioned I would be open to flying on a partner airline since it is mentioned on their website they can do that. They wouldn't budge, and they wouldn't book me on the Alaska / Hawaiian flight combo either.

kk28ww5,2024-01-29 12:31:03,"Hwn Air has lost their minds lately with these prices, yup yup.

I fly them - a lot - at least 2-3 a week.

I don't have the Barclay card, but as far as I know, the main benefit is the free checked bags.  Just having the card doesn't give you Pualani Gold or Platinum - that has to be earned by 20,000 miles or 30 segments or 40,000 miles or 60 segments during any calendar year.

More on that here: [https://hawaiianair.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/1874](https://hawaiianair.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1874) 

 You said ""If I wanted to catch the 6am flight to Hilo from town, can I buy a cheaper ticket for later in the day, then come back? I also assume can I do the same on the departure? Trying to see family and spend the most of the day from 6am to 6pm..""  .  Not sure I understand exactly what you are asking but no doubt you want to do it the least expensive way, and are willing to do standby?   \*Usually\* standby would be used for a flight later - or earlier - than your current ticket. So if you bought the 6:00am there is no earlier flight, and if you didn't board the 6:00 it seems they \*might\* let you on a later one... like you show up later and tell them you missed 6:00 can they help?  Sounds risky.  For the return, you might be onto something.  If the return at say, 7:10pm is cheaper then the one you want - say at 6:00pm, then showing up at 5:00 with your Barclay card they may show some love.

Another thing to check out is Southwest (can't even believe I'm saying that, ugh.) - I am fiercely loyal to Hawaiian but had to fly SW because I had to leave in very short notice and HA couldn't help - it wasn't so bad... Your call there.

I go back and forth between the islands - not for business or work - but for 'Ohana.  It's hard when everyone is spread out across multiple island - and expensive.  I miss the days you could buy the ticket books at the stands - haven't seen that in over 20 years  - but last time it was $290 - I think - for a book of 10!  The worst is holidays - when the \*know\* everyone want to see family... instead of giving break, they jack the price - it's just greed - but after-all they are a business and answer to shareholders - but show \*some\* Aloha!  

Not even sure I answered your question?",PoieWoie,4,1adj0e6,na

la35uk1,2024-06-25 02:34:06,"Seconding left (port) side of aircraft for departure. Under normal conditions, this will give you the classic Honolulu/Waikiki skyline and Diamond Head views. I also prefer this side for arrivals. You'll get views of Ko Olina, West Oahu, Central Oahu, and the airport as your flight lines-up for and lands. However, while the aircraft flies along the South Shore on the way to its turning point for line-up near Ko Olina, you won't see anything.

The above is for normals ops only. If the winds shift to what we call ""Kona winds,"" everything reverses. Aircraft will fly straight over Honolulu and land without double backing near Ko Olina, and will depart facing Ko Olina instead of Honolulu.

In even rarer circumstances, arriving flights will fly between Kaua'i and Oahu, turning towards Honolulu after passing Ka'ena Point. In this case, only those sitting on the left will have any view whatsoever.

Whether you're charged the Main Cabin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 depends on revenue management, which is a cryptic, proprietary process airlines use to price out their tickets. However, if demand for certain routes/dates is high, it's a safe bet that the prices will be, too. 

The prices for first class are the same as main - they're for one-way tickets. So, you know, if you're getting Main Cabin 3 or higher, it makes more sense to book first class if you're seeing First Class 1 award prices. 

Your specific dates are close to Thanksgiving, hence the higher prices. Your only options are really to 1) choose different dates, 2) wait and hope that prices come down later, 3) transfer Amex Membership Rewards points to HawaiianMiles if you've got um, or 4) pay cash.",Kyo46,3,1dq78fu,na

**Additional Fees for Oversize Baggage**. When a bag exceeds an Outside Linear Dimension of 62 inches (157 cm), it will incur an additional oversize charge as follows, which is in addition to the Standard Bag fee and any overweight fees.

   1. Baggage with an Outside Linear Dimension greater than 62 inches (157 cm), but not exceeding an Outside Linear Dimension of 80 inches (203 cm):
      1. Between points within the State of Hawaii, the additional oversize baggage fee is $35.00 per oversized piece.
      2. For Domestic travel that is not wholly within the State of Hawaii, the additional oversize baggage fee is $200.00 for each oversized piece.
   2. Baggage in excess of the stated dimensions above will not be accepted, except as expressly provided elsewhere in this¬†Rule 18.

Each time, I've brought back 4-5 pieces of luggage, a mix of regular suitcases, large duffel bags, u-haul cardboard boxes, and plastic storage containers. As long as they're under 50 lbs and meet the dimension criteria (under 62 inches L+W+H), you pay regular bag fees. Cardboard is kind of flimsy, so I shipped clothing in those boxes. The plastic (Costco/Walmart/Home Depot) storage containers are better for more fragile items. The more square the box, the more volume you get for the max allowed dimension. Uhaul's large cardboard moving box at 24x18x18 is closest to this max. 
This past year, I was able to bring back 5 pieces free each trip because of my miles status and Hawaiian credit card. I think fees are normally $30 - 1st bag, $40 - 2nd ($15/20 if you're a Hawaiian miles member) inter-island, $40/45 to the mainland.",Funny-Car-9945,2,1fr0wvq,na

lrpah5d,2024-10-13 18:55:18,"&gt; The whole flight of 400+ people was diverted and cancelled because of one (1) pet dog.

Yes... while I hope it was cathartic, as you suggest, to write out your experience on reddit, I would not expect sympathy from this subreddit by suggesting that someone's dog should have died so you could go on vacation.

After reading your post, the unfortunate truth is that you signed a contract that you did not understand. You purchased an itinerary that had no room for any disruption, but neglected to understand the airline's responsibilities to you in the event of a disruption. 

&gt; On top of that, Hawaiian Airlines announced that they scrambled a flight out at 1am the next day, well after we'd cancelled our travel package and while in the middle of the call with customer service.

Yes, because there was zero room in your itinerary for error, you abandoned your trip and began requesting compensation immediately upon the diversion. A 1AM flight from Oakland would arrive on Oahu at 3AM, if you had not cancelled your trip, you would have gotten there a day late. 

&gt; I just can't get over just how much hassle and frustration and uncertainty we had to go through.

You booked a 3-day trip with a toddler on an airline that operates one flight a day. No form of travel is 100% reliable, even if the equipment is fine, a medical diversion would have resulted in exactly the same outcome on your end, with even less compensation due to you. Not purchasing travel insurance, on a three day trip to hawaii, was a mistake.

It's unfortunate that you were unable to visit Hawaii, but the majority of the hassle, frustration and uncertainty that you experienced was avoidable by better understanding the contracts you had agreed to, and by purchasing disruption insurance on an itinerary you chose that had zero room for disruption.",ChequeOneTwoThree,25,1g2md8h,na

It‚Äôs how they drive loyalty.

Next time we flew with them (stupid, I know) I found out that you can‚Äôt check in your minor on the app you have to do it at the terminal which is a nightmare in Oakland and extended the time you‚Äôre in the airport with a little crazy person which is far from ideal.

kyg1nv5,2024-04-07 16:56:43,"FWIW it looks like the plane you were supposed to fly on is flying back to HNL tomorrow. Which probably means maintenance issue on that particular plane which should be fixed by tomorrow‚Äôs flight. They sent you back (assuming you flied the delayed flight) on the plane that came in tonight, immediately turning it around in SAN.

Regarding if it was ever really ‚Äòcancelled‚Äô that was probably a major f*ck up by the SAN operations. If they indeed announce and post on the boards ‚Äòcancelled‚Äô and told you to book another airline, then they should honor some form of refund. I will say despite it being a major miscommunication, probably by someone who spoke too soon or gave erroneous information, prepare that they may only offer you flight credit.

In the future, it would be wisest to always try to arrange your rebooked flight through whichever airline you‚Äôre flying. If they cancel the flight, they are obligated to get you rebooked on another one of their flights, or on a partner airline (if available) at no additional cost.

I‚Äôll make the same suggestion I made on the PDX post.
1) Get in line to talk to a gate agent while simultaneously calling the reservations line, get help from whoever gets to you first.
2) Travel insurance. If you have it, see if anything is covered so far. If not, consider getting some in the future. This shit can happen with every airline.",Temporary_Cow_2340,3,1bxmskk,na

Currently, the two free bags only applies to the cardholder, not the student or your aunt that you bought the tickets for or your spouse/travel partner.

For example:  say you want four bags to be checked in free if you and your spouse/travel partner have separate (not joint) HA credit cards?  Book separately using your own HA credit card for your ticket and then your spouse/travel partner purchase their ticket on the website with their HA credit card. 

Having the card alone does NOT give you the benefit.  It's called a loyalty card. Hope this helps anyone out there using the HA credit card.

I booked  rental car with 50,000 miles back in March but had to reschedule to June, when I went to rebook I was shocked to see I had no miles left even after cancelling properly per Hawaiian Airlines agents and insuring me my miles would return to my account. I too had to fill out a form to justify getting my miles back which is completely ridiculous since, why do I need to justify what's mine? I'm stilling waiting for a resolution.

Oh any my June flight from SFO --&gt; HNL was cancelled less then 24 hours before my departure because of ""maintenance issues"" and I got a text telling me a rep would contact me with alternative options shortly. Well several hours went by without any calls from Hawaiian Airlines and  \*I\* had to rebook a new flight out myself. When I escalated to a manager she was super useless and kept having to repeat myself, best she gave me were $100 vouchers for a future flight, which you guessed it I still haven't received. A rep told me I need to fill out that stupid form again to get the vouchers, I told them why when a manager was the one who already approved them? They just said that's all they can do for me.

Uplift is just giving you a loan‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no reason they would need a partnership in order to loan you money to sell you a ticket.

However, if Hawaiian is no longer partnering with Uplift, that‚Äôs not a great sign. I‚Äôve never heard of uplift before, but you can probably find some reviews out there if you look. 

&gt; And yes it‚Äôs legit because when I went to cancel my trip due to some changes I needed to make, the trip was cancelled successfully with no issues.

You did this through Hawaiian Airlines?

&gt; Mind you on uplift website it says they work in collaboration.

Collaboration doesn‚Äôt mean anything legally binding. They can argue that since Uplift has a link to the Hawaiian airlines website, they are in collaboration.

Uplift is going to use all sorts of language to make you think they have a partnership, but uplift is just buying a ticket on your behalf‚Ä¶ Hawaiian isn‚Äôt helping them but it also can‚Äôt stop them.

kyetcmq,2024-04-07 09:59:45,"You should see if Hawaiian violated any of its [Customer Service Plan](https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/about-us/customer-service-plan) or the [DOT Passenger Bill of Rights](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-cancellation-delay-dashboard?carrier_target_id=29841) when it comes to how the responded.

If you believe that they violated their customer service plan or DOT regulations, you should file a [DOT Complaint](https://secure.dot.gov/air-travel-complaint)

I think you mentioned they provided a meal voucher, and I believe you may have qualified for a hotel and/or ground transportation. Not sure though, because you were at your home airport. Also, the fact that you voluntarily rebooked to a later flight, not sure if that disqualifies you from getting your extra taxi ride from/to the airport reimbursed. Either way, save your receipts and submit for reimbursement.

Do you have any travel insurance? Either bought outright or through a travel credit card? If you did, some coverage may already be applicable. If not, probably a good idea to consider travel insurance in the future.

Regarding the gate agent‚Äôs handling of the situation, I agree that it‚Äôs not in line with how any customer service employee should behave. You should reach out to Hawaiian Airlines and submit an account of the situation so they can potentially follow up and correct the behavior. 

Not to excuse any of their behavior or how Tim missed some key details, in your opinion, but consider that they potentially have a plane of 200+ passengers who either want an update, need meal vouchers, want to switch to a different flight or anything other possibility. Also, it makes complete sense that they would not be concerned about your connecting flight OGG&gt;KOA because they probably don‚Äôt have any estimate as to when/if your PDX&gt;OGG plane will even get off the ground. If you were concerned about arriving in Kahului in the middle of the night and having to wait for a morning connecting flight, moving to the next confirmed flight is the right move.

Since you were willing to rebook to a later flight, I would suggest that as an alternate to waiting for the limited gate agents to help, you could call the reservations line to get rebooked. Best to get in line while simultaneously calling and waiting for a reservations agent, take help from whoever you get to first, whether on the phone or the gate agent.",Temporary_Cow_2340,5,1bxqrnb,na

llbvsjf,2024-09-04 00:45:09,And we should expect Southwest to do the same,ChequeOneTwoThree,3,1f7vcuj,na
llihwmp,2024-09-04 00:45:09,"Yep. These ""concerns"" have nothing to do with public interest. They're all about business interest. United profits off its codeshare agreement with Hawaiian, and Southwest wouldn't want a stronger competitor here.",Kyo46,1,1f7vcuj,llbvsjf
lldg23t,2024-09-04 05:45:11,"Tbh, this is the step in the right direction because the AS and HA merger shouldn‚Äôt happen. Sure HA would be bankrupt if the merger doesn‚Äôt go through but, they have been bankrupt before and will work on getting themselves out of it anyway. In my eyes, if this merger goes through, Southwest will be forced to leave the Hawaiian market and thus giving the monopoly back to Hawaiian on a silver platter, meaning higher prices for people to travel throughout the islands. It‚Äôs not good for consumers if you look at the overall picture because time after time, passengers have always looked for the lowest prices to go places. With this merger, it will raise prices and not make it affordable anymore for people to travel throughout the islands. On an even larger scale, look at the Canadian market for domestic travelers. There are Westjet and Air Canada. Due to Air Canada being on the East Coast and Westjet on the West coast, they can largely charge what they want for the flights they operate because there‚Äôs a lack of competition, similar to the inter island market in Hawaii.",One-Imagination-1230,3,1f7vcuj,na
llemgz6,2024-09-04 05:45:11,So in other words you‚Äôre pro people losing their jobs as long as you get to fly cheaper.  Gotcha.,Kazutaka_Muraki,6,1f7vcuj,lldg23t
llihm1k,2024-09-04 05:45:11,"If the merger goes through, Southwest won't be forced to leave Hawai'i. Despite what the media is reporting, Southwest sees Hawai'i as a long-term investment that will bring in additional profits to the carrier as a whole, even if their Hawai'i ops continues to lose money. However, they won't see the fruits of their efforts until, at minimum, they begin operating redeye flights are and able to issue itineraries from cities in the central and eastern U.S. - something they can't do right now. 

By the way, Southwest is a major reason why Hawaiian is facing bankruptcy today and why they won't survive going into the future. The pricing pressure Southwest is putting on Hawaiian (you know, the consumer good you're talking about) is partly why Hawaiian is hemoraging money. Hawaiian blames lack of Japanese demand, and that's certainly part of it. But, we could already see their finances getting stressed when Southwest began ops here back in 2019, too. 

If the merger fails, there just a couple things that can happen:

* **Private Equity:** the airline will be run into the ground by private equity firms after the squeeze as much value out of it that they can. One is attempting this with Southwest today (Elliot's turnaround pan for Southwest is pure stupidity), and another is trying this with JetBlue. 
* **Liquidation:** Hawaiian has no concrete strategy to return to sustainable profitability. How can it when a competitor like Southwest is systematically targeting Hawaiian's most profitable markets and is willing to take losses on them? In this case, Southwest gains a monopoly on inter-island flying. How's that better than the opposite. Moreover, the likelihood of an airline with the financial resources to acquire Hawaiian aside from Alaska getting regulatory approval to do so is slim. And in this case, Hawaiian will likely disappear and become part of that airline anyway. For example, if United were to acquire Hawaiian, they'd probably just be combined with their Micronesia operations since they have a lot of infrastructure here for that anyway. 

The intra-Hawai'i market is far different from the days of Aloha and Hawaiian. There's a lot of direct flights to Kaua'i, Maui, and Hawai'i Island, which lessens the need for inter-island flights. This plus the cost of operating inter-island flights make the business case difficult. There's reason to believe that the market can only handle a single carrier.",Kyo46,3,1f7vcuj,lldg23t
llx0qcu,2024-09-04 05:45:11,Not sure why people are rooting for thousands of people to lose their jobs by not wanting this merger so they can fly cheaper (which wouldn‚Äôt happen btw cause Southwest would raise prices with HA out of the way).,Original_Mammoth_967,1,1f7vcuj,lldg23t

My preferred method for getting HA 1st class is outright at booking through Virgin Atlantic on D fares.  You have to verify partner availability for D fare code seats (again through Expert Flyer, or JetBlue but that‚Äôs a painful alternative).  Then using transferrable credit card points (Amex, Chase, Citi, Cap1, etc) convert those to Virgin Red Points.  Call Virgin with the flight information and book over the phone.  This is the best method for me since there are nearly perpetual transfer bonuses with Virgin Atlantic of 20-30% extra.  So those 1st class flights end up costing only 31,000 points many times.

When any changes are made for any flights (either I made the change or airline made the change).  They don't charge a change fee but ALWAYS charge a fare difference.

I sleep on my stomach with my arms under my head and can't fully lie down like that on the 330 while I could on all the other airlines. The tablets instead of an in-seat TV is annoying.

However, Hawaiian really does set itself apart from the rest of the pack with their service. The flight attendants have been great, the food is good, and the atmosphere is much more welcoming than that of an American crew that obviously doesn't want to be there.

I would still say it's special and probably on par with the other guys. The seat is worse, but the experience is better. For me it evens out. 

The way things are now, I wouldn't expect any 330 equipment swaps. However, with the Alaska merger coming, there's no real guarantee that any west coast flying wouldn't get swapped for 2 737s. June 2025 might be a little soon for the integration, but it is coming",Adventurous-Ad8219,1,1e0z4vx,na

But let me warn you that changing terminals at LAX may really suck. HA flies out of the internal terminal at LAX, so you‚Äôre gonna have to change terminals which is not fun at LAX‚Äîyou‚Äôll have to take a shuttle I think. To make matters worse, they fly out of this very far set of ‚Äúauxiliary‚Äù gates (the west gates of 200 gates) that are part of the international terminal.. which adds another 15-20 minutes (half a mile or so) of walking. So that terminal change at LAX might end up taking up to 45 minutes of walking in the airport. 

Now.. is the A330 first class special? Ya it‚Äôs pretty cool and your idea sounds fun to do with a big group. The 787 first class is technically better and more private for each person, but the A330 is an intimate first class cabin. Everyone will be able to see each other and talk to each other.

lpxiu7e,2024-10-02 12:46:49,"HA policies are pretty brutal in flight changes and fare credits based on responses from their CSR as I understood (which I could be wrong on or have changed since AS take over). My understanding is you get one change to apply a fare credit including if paying the difference for a more expensive flight. There are no further rebooking or use of unused credit was what chat CSR conveyed. Under that premise, it depends how that ticket is treated but my guess is that you might just be paying more to lock yourself in even more to that particular flight.

Keep in mind there is no way to hold Minicoochi accountable to really keeping the Hawaiian Airlines brand, or whoever takes the helm afterwards. The brand will disappear. 

Coochi really wants Alaska to go international and this is his shortcut. Hawaiian will have the new 787s and the international gates already.  Don‚Äôt be surprised if the 787s end up just going from the mainland to other international destinations.  I wonder how it will impact Hawaiian Airlines‚Äô relationship with JAL and Korean Airlines.

As I‚Äôve flown on Alaska and Hawaiian, I can say that the service on Alaska is far less than what Hawaiian provides. Since the service will reflect the amount of pay crew will receive, I would predict that Hawaiian will drop many services and duties while in the air to justify lowering pay. 

Coochi and Ingram have been focusing on the lack of overlap of routes, but if you look at just the Mainland-Hawaii routes, they will then have more percentage of routes than all the other US carriers, so don‚Äôt expect any relief for consumers, it‚Äôll most likely inflate.

I kept monitoring the website and calling every week. Last week when I called the agent had multiple seats available not showing on the website that were suddenly available to book. So now my family is seated together. 

So my advice if you‚Äôre not willing to pay the money is to keep calling. And go for the angle not of all of you together but making sure every kid is next to at least one adult. That gives them more flexibility.

ljq9b6c,2024-08-25 00:58:24,"You can cancel the ticket, and will get the miles back, but it takes about a week.

Agents can book you a ticket with miles that will take your account negative in the case you need to rebook immediately. I had to twist their arm to get them to do it, but it is possible. I remember first being told it was impossible, but a supervisor relented when I insisted on a solution. It may have also helped that I am pualani platinum, but I assure you it's technically possible, regardless of they are willing to extend the same courtesy.

Obviously, they will only do this if you have enough miles already to cover any fare difference, and you won't be able to book anything else with miles while your account is negative.

l8sbbu3,2024-06-16 07:00:47,"Hard to tell cause of the minimal details your provided, but sounds like you may be conflating two different issues: schedule changes and involuntary bumping/denied boarding.

Regarding schedule changes. Yes, schedule changes are common among all airlines, especially when you book more than a few months in advance. Best case scenario: they only change your flight by a few minutes to an hour, Worse case: they stop flying that route all together. 

Since you are flying SFO/KOA on Hawaiian, you have to connect in HNL. According to Hawaiian‚Äôs website, their [minimum connection time](https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/Minimum-Connection-Times) for Neighbor Island flights and North America flights is 65 minutes. In theory, you could call reservations and ask if you could get a later flight out of KOA to reduce your 4 hour layover in HNL. But remember that KOA&gt;HNL flights are only about every hour, so you might still end up with a longer layover. What doesn‚Äôt make sense in your story is that (I‚Äôm assuming) your HNL&gt;SFO leg got rescheduled for later, but your KOA&gt;HNL leg got rescheduled ‚Äúto match‚Äù? But how did you end up with a longer layover than before? Unless you already had a long layover or kept the original KOA&gt;HNL flight.

Regarding involuntary bumping, yes, the fact that you paid with miles vs. money (along with many other factors) does make a difference if the flight is oversold and they don‚Äôt get enough volunteers to switch. According to their [Rule 22](https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/legal/domestic-contract-of-carriage/rule-22) in their Contract of Carriage:

‚ÄúGenerally, all guests holding seat assignments will be boarded. The priority of guests who are not holding seat assignment and, if necessary, other guests may be determined based on a guest‚Äôs fare class, itinerary, status of frequent flyer program membership, and the time in which the guest presents him/herself for check in without an advanced seat assignment.‚Äù

Tickets purchased with miles are a different (probably lower) fare class than those purchased with money. But, sometimes, if all else is equal, and they still don‚Äôt have enough volunteers, it may come down to who checked in later.",Temporary_Cow_2340,1,1dgsh14,na
