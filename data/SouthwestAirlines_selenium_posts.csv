zx2jv0,2022-12-28 14:32:43,Just your friendly neighborhood ramp rat‚Ä¶,"with some information and a request.

What a wonderful way to spend the holidays and enter the new year. Passengers left stranded. Entire families, parents with young children and infants, wheelchair passengers, the elderly, unaccompanied minors and youth travelers. Thousands unable to get home, to get back to their loved ones. Everyone has the right to be upset. It should‚Äôve never gotten to this level.

SWAPA (Southwest Airlines Pilots Association) and TWU 556 (Southwest Airlines Flight Attendants Union) have called out the airline‚Äôs technology failures for awhile now. Google either of the unions and their pickets, the information is out there. You can all point fingers at Bob Jordan, he‚Äôs the current CEO. Yes, he‚Äôs had some time to make improvements. Yes, he‚Äôs even quoted bringing up the technology that needs to be improved. But all of this has been brewing since Gary Kelly was CEO‚Ä¶and let‚Äôs not forget GK is still Executive Chairman of the board. Again, google is your friend. It‚Äôs all online.

The decisions made to not cancel flights came from the executive level. Station managers across the system held meetings requesting more cancelations before Storm Elliot hit, citing safety concerns, equipments freezing, etc. Those requests were shut down. 

Pilots and flight attendants are stranded just like the rest of you. They cannot get ahold of scheduling. All those legal and illegal to fly have been on hold for 6-20+ hours. Yes, over 20 hours spent trying to get ahold of someone because they have not slept and have not eaten. Many are trying to alert crew scheduling that they‚Äôre stranded in a city/state they shouldn‚Äôt be in, some are trying to call in fatigue. The rules of calling in sick are strict, but the rules of calling in ‚Äúfatigue‚Äù are even stricter. You must get ahold of someone to call it in without repercussions. Many of our pilots and flight attendants are desperately trying to work whatever flights they can. So many are volunteering for flights they can legally work knowing fully well that when they land, there probably won‚Äôt be a hotel for them to rest their heads. I cannot put into words the amount of respect I have for the flight crews sacrificing what little stability they have left to get our passengers home. 

DIA has an estimated 10,000 bags unclaimed. There is no word on the other stations. All rampers across the system are loading those bags as fast and as safe as possible. Bag counts of 300+ on flights that allow it. All those cancelled they just announced yesterday? There are planes are still going out but with just pilots and crews, and as many bags as we can fit. We don‚Äôt know when you‚Äôll get your bag. And no, we can‚Äôt give you your bag back because it would take pulling hundreds of employees offline, across the system, to search and sort through it all. No one is refusing to give you your bag back just for fun. It‚Äôs a direct work order given by leadership. I think you can all imagine what the consequences of refusing a direct work order are. Baggage service employees have their supervisors breathing down their neck, a trickle down effect of the pressures put on them from higher up management. If they could give you back your bag, they would. 

The state of operational letter that leaked from DEN ramp is nothing new. SOEs have become a frequent thing in the last couple of years - all across the system. The rumor of 100-300 ramp agents walking out is unfounded. DEN ramp had nearly 1000 rampers employed before Storm Elliot hit and they STILL have nearly 1000 rampers today. Did some agents quit the night of the storm? I‚Äôm sure some did. Keyword ‚Äúsome.‚Äù How many of us would work in those elements with the warning of frostbite occurring on exposed skin in as little as five minutes? I am honestly surprised that it took this long for a SOE letter to leak. Did anyone hear about the previous ones from BWI, MDW, DAL? How about the ones from PHX, when they were literally in effect every weekend earlier this year? Ramp agents are expected to stack thousands of pounds of bags and cargo freight, with quick downloads and uploads (regardless of how staffed the gate is), in every type of weather imaginable, and STILL have days where they must fight for their legally owed lunch breaks. SOEs are what happen when you treat people like machines.

Our customer service agents and operations agents have all been on their feet for hours on end, trying to do what they can with what they have to get you on a flight. They do not decide which flights cancel and which ones don‚Äôt. HDQ makes those decisions, they are just the unfortunate messengers. The verbal and physical assaults they have received is absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable. It is saddening to know that they have been in the direct line of fire, and will continue to be in the direct line of fire, in the days to come.

We‚Äôre tired. Our ramp agents. Our customer service agents. Our baggage service agents. Our operations agents. Our flight attendants. Our pilots. Our unseen phone agents handling the failing phone lines. Our crew scheduling trying to figure out who is where and who is legal to fly. Our departments in headquarters all working behind the scenes to figure out this mess. Every single employee trying to fix this is tired but we are still trying. 

We want to get you home. We want you to be with your families. We know so many of you are expected to be back at work by now, to continue providing for yourselves and your families. We know you have all spent money to find a new way to get home, to replace the warm clothes that are in your checked luggage, to keep your families fed with a safe place to stay‚Ä¶all the while not getting answers.

I ask for patience. I ask for kindness. I ask for compassion. We don‚Äôt have the answers you are seeking. This is above all of us now.

If this post stays up long enough for Bob Jordan to read, I ask you to face the media and stand up for us. You‚Äôve made video updates for us when WE know what‚Äôs going on. WE have been through this time and time again. WE have been promised that change is coming. Let the public know what‚Äôs going on. You have employees scared to come into work, afraid to be in uniform. Folks are reposting mental health services left and right. We‚Äôre all leaning on each as best we can but enough is enough. Show us you‚Äôre the change we‚Äôve been waiting for.



TL;DR

we all knew something of this magnitude would eventually happen, y‚Äôall have already dealt with similar incidents in the last couple of years. this failure is at the executive level. don‚Äôt just look at bob jordan, look at all the suits that have been there for the last 5 years. they are all accountable. the folks who are trying to help you are not to blame. there is no strike. there no extreme sick outs or walk offs. the ‚Äústaffing issue‚Äù is not lack of staff, but poorly managed staff. we‚Äôre here. we‚Äôre working. we so badly want to help you. decisions are being made that we have no part in. ultimately we already knew it was profits over people. now you all get to see it too.

1fw7c8r,2024-10-05 03:17:25,Rant/AIO: SWA Gave My Plane Away,"Yesterday Tampa was hit by bad storms, like my 20 minute drive to the airport took 75 minutes with street flooding and an accident. Still the apps (SWA &amp; Flight Aware) all showed my flight on time to only 10 minutes delayed, so I got to the 85 minutes early to return rental check bag, etc. Again, I would have 140 minutes early if not for the delayed drive in.

As I got to the TPA airport, my plane for the 6:55pm TPA-MSY flight had to circle in northern FL for the weather to pass. Still, I got to the gate and waited for the flight as it still could be on time.

The storm lasted about two hours and was hard the whole time. When I got to the gate, visibility in Tampa was low but soon the storm passed, visibility was good, and my plane headed south to TPA. The flight was delayed but we were going to be within 30 min of schedule which was good, all things considered.

Literally, as the plane was 10 miles out from the airport, SWA makes an announcement they are giving our 737-700 to TPA-BWI and we would have to get another plane which would now be around 11:17pm departure (4+ hrs).

I fly SWA because I like the company culture and I like having direct routes for work trips. Yet, I kept wondering if I‚Äôd have this issue if I‚Äôd connected home on a Big 3 airline. 

Never seen SWA reroute a plane last minute before and SWA is already on thin ice with me. So, instead of being home before 10pm last night, it was well after 1am (it is a long drive for me to be a loyal SWA A-Lister).

The TPA-MSY fight was put on a Max with in seat power (first time for me on SWA). Only 75 ppl on the 175 seat plane. Not sure how many dropped or rebooked once the flight was delayed but I felt like SWA probably saw fewer MSY passengers and decided to keep a larger number of BWI fliers happy.

Still, pretty disappointed for SWA to pull this last minute. If they had done it hours earlier, I would have had options other than spending 5 hours in a terminal.

SWA has been my favorite for decades but I have been mulling a switch to a big 3 as I can save 75 minutes each way to the airport and my kid wants to travel international to Europe where my several hundred thousand rapid rewards points will not help.

1dyjxyg,2024-07-09 04:58:16,"Thank you, Southwest, for getting me home to say goodbye to my beloved dog and your kindness in the process.","I've been wanting to make this post for a few days, but every time I've sat down to type it out I just couldn't bring myself to put all my thanks into words, but hopefully this is sufficient.

On 6/25, my partner and I loaded up in Nashville and made the long trek to Honolulu with 6 friends. It's a trip we'd been planning for months and were both eagerly looking forward to. We are fortunate to travel pretty regularly, but not with a group of friends so this was especially exciting. However, we had 4 dogs at home and that always caused some anxiety when we travel. 1 is a 14-year-old male dachshund in a wheelchair (Governor), 1 13-year-old a female beagle (Layla) that was diagnosed with kidney disease in October and undergoes a variation of dialysis a couple times a week, 1 13-year-old male beagle (Baxter) and 1 12-year-old female chiweenie (Mini).  Fortunately, we both have wonderful parents who are extremely supportive of our travels and stay at our house with the dogs while we are away so they are never boarded.

I'm going to skip ahead a bit here through some phone calls and a couple missed meals, but Mini died suddenly the afternoon of 6/26. According to my vet, she didn't think it was preventable. Based on the way Mini presented in the hours before her passing, it seems like it may have been an intestinal rupture or something quick that was unavoidable and undetectable.  My partner and I gathered our things after not having been in Hawaii for quite 24 hours and began our journey home. I called Southwest immediately from the rental car and said, ""I need to change my flight and get back to Nashville immediately."" I gave the agent on the phone my name and she said, ""You want to go to Nashville today? Didn't you just arrive in Hawaii yesterday?"" I told her that I had, but my dog died and I need to get back ASAP.

Since I was driving in an unfamiliar area and trying to get to the airport as quickly as humanly possible I told the agent I didn't have any of my booking details handy. She assured me that was ok and that she could handle it. She had me wait a couple minutes and then came back on the line and told me that my partner and I were booked on the next flight out. It was at this moment I realized that I'd need to pay the difference in fare. I asked the agent what the charge was and assured her it didn't matter what it was, I was going home regardless. She informed me that it was $750, but added, ""Don't worry, I waived the fee. Get home to your dog."" So, there I am bawling my eyes out trying to get to the Daniel K. Inouye airport at the kindness of this stranger.

My partner and I arrive at the airport and begin the trek home. I submit a ticket on the Southwest app just to say thanks for waiving the fee and how much it meant to me. At some point, during one of the legs home I had to get up and use the restroom. There is a short line in the rear of the plane so I stand and wait my turn. As I'm waiting, one of the flight attendants asks me if everything is ok. I guess my face was swollen and my partner and I had been crying on and off during the flight and normally I'm the type of person to say, ""Yea, I'm good. Thanks."", but not that day. I told her no, I wasn't good. My dog had died and I just wasn't in a good spot at the moment. She expressed her condolences and told me that my partner and I could have any drink we wanted and to just let her know. I told her I appreciated it and used the restroom and went back to my seat.

About 5 mins after sitting down, this flight attendant brought my partner and I a handwritten card and some Southwest goodies. It was all simple stuff: coloring book, mini playing cards, pilot's wings, keychain, etc. She said that she and her colleagues were so sorry for our loss, but hoped these simple things could make us smile for a moment. Well, mission accomplished. We couldn't help but smile at the prospect of two mid-thirties men getting a coloring book from flight attendants.

Upon landing, I thanked the flight attendants again and deplaned and rushed home. We got to see our girl for the last time before kissing her goodbye and having her taken to be cremated and returned to us the next morning. It was her only night away from home.

Later that day I received an email from Southwest again expressing their condolences on the loss of my dog and once again, I cried. Southwest went above and beyond in their attempts to make me feel seen and respected during a moment of deep grief and sadness. I will never be able to repay them for the kindness they showed me that day. Thank you, Southwest and thank you to flight crew 2173!

I've added some photos for those Reddit folks that live in the ""pix or it didn't happen"" world. I've also added a picture of Mini because she was too cute not to and I miss her every day.

TL;DR My dog died suddenly one day into a trip to Hawaii and Southwest was incredibly kind at every turn.

Apparently for the last couple of months, there‚Äôs been a glitch in the system where when you book a flight through say, SAP Concur like I had to for work, it may not reflect the points you are so rightly owed after taking the flight: This is because the system can‚Äôt differentiate what category of flight you purchased and therefore cannot allocate points. 

So if you‚Äôve had to book through a system like Concur in the last few months, I would double check your points have been credited. If not, you can call SW and the CS agent will manually push it through, though expect it to take like 15 mins.

17uq8bg,2023-11-14 09:01:48,I think something fell in my yard from a Southwest flight,"So, this seems crazy but I can't come up with a better explanation.

I was in my backyard today and I found an expensive Motorola UHF radio. I have a few acres and the only plausible explanation was that the lawn guys dropped it, or so I thought. I reached out to them and they don't use radios.

I do live pretty close to a small town airport, however I am not in the flightpath of the runways. The airport is also very slow, unmanned tower, no commercial flights, etc.

I went back on my cameras, and saw the radio landed a couple days ago @ 4:36pm. It was literally not there one frame and next frame it was there. It had just rained, so it didn't bounce at all in the grass/dirt.

I went back and checked Flightradar, and there was only one plane that even passed over my side of town - and the flight path literally went directly over my house (at 38,000ft). It passed over my house @ 4:30pm on that day.

I don't know the terminal velocity of a Motorola radio, but I do know a baseballs' is \~71mph. Which falling from 38k feet would take \~6 minutes. Timeline fits perfectly, plane passes @ 4:30 and radio hits ground @ 4:36

This would have obviously been a radio from ground crew/baggage/etc and not anything flight related. But for the life of me I can't picture how/where it could stay in place from takeoff and make it all the way to 38,000ft before coming loose. I am about \~350 miles from the originating airport and about \~500 miles from the destination airport.

There are no initials/names/ID/numbering on the radio. It was still switched on when I found it, battery obviously dead.

I guess my question is this, is this plausible? Or does anyone know if SW uses this equipment? Not looking for anything, just glad it didn't land on my car or my head. That would have been really hard to explain to insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Radio fell in my backyard several minutes after SW flight passed directly overhead @ 38k

Southwest's A-List and A-List Preferred Status comes with some nice perks and I'm thankful for them, especially the priority boarding, free Same Day Confirmed Flight Change, and ""A61"" benefits.

**If you had one other perk that you would wish üå† your Southwest status should include, what would it be?**

One of my wishes: As one who has both Global Entry and Status with Southwest, one of my long wishes has been to have the Priority Express Lane benefit at TSA Checkpoints feed to the front of the PreCheck Lane and not just standard screening. CLEAR currently gives this option, so why not the Priority Lane? I know that implementing this goes beyond Southwest's control but that is one on my Southwest Status Wishlist that would not require a separate CLEAR membership. 

But what's your wish? If you're A-List and A-List preferred, what is on your wishlist?

16b03pz,2023-09-06 05:03:04,"I have flown southwest more than 50 times in the past few years, and I have never encountered the awfulness I see in this sub","Everyday I look in here and see people complaining about dozens of pre-boarders, rude interactions, crazy delays/cancellations, and the like. 

I've flown less popular routes, more popular routes, directs, connections, double connections, hell I even worked for SWA a year ago, and throughout all of this it was always a positive experience.

I know that the sort of people who come to a subreddit for an airline are usually going to be more likely to complain than the average customer, but still, having the top post every day being complaining about pre-boarders or whatever irks them the most is lame.

In the ~60 flights i've taken, i've had a few delays, all less than an hour, a few more gate changes, and only one cancelation, the day before.

I also know that this isn't just my experience, only about 3% of SWA's flights are cancelled, and they're #2 in ontime percentage, only below Delta.

When I check in 24hrs in advance I almost always get middle B boarding group, and even when I've gotten C, even late C, I've always been able to find a window or aisle seat and never needed to gate check.

From my time working at Southwest, it seemed to me that the majority of customers had a similar experience to me, and not only has Southwest been consistently enjoyable, it has also been significantly cheaper than other options. 

When I book my flights far in advance, i'm frequently getting huge discounts by flying SWA, and when booking just a bit prior i'm usually getting a better deal. For context, I always fly whatever is cheapest unless it has significant layovers or there is a only slightly more expensive direct option, and that almost always leads to me flying Southwest and then a bit of Spirit, Allegiant, United, American, and usually Delta for international.

I'm just a bit tired of the constant, repetitive, and frankly not that bad of complaints here.",NosikaOnline,111,320,SouthwestAirlines

Lax to Cancun with two possible layovers.

1. 1155pm to 11am - Through Nashville (bna) - lax to bna is 3hrs 50 mins, layover is 2hrs 20 mins. Bna to Cancun is 3hrs for a total travel time of 9 hrs 15 mins.

Should I go Houston for the shorter travel time (but longer layover time) or Nashville for the shorter layover time (but longer flight time)?

Should possible weather delays be considered? Going in early spring. I would think going thru Nashville (flying thru the plains) may see more storms vs Houston (flying south)?

They rebooked my outgoing flight to arrive at 6:45 PM. They rebooked my flight back back home to leave at 6:55 PM.  Both flights on 9/27.  

Not a big deal. I know I have the option to reschedule.  At least I thought I did. 

Problem is, when I spoke with two different Southwest representatives, I was informed that since these flights were booked during the promotional period for the companion pass that I no longer am eligible to receive it since my flights were changed. I did not change my flights. Southwest canceled both flights, twice. Southwest randomly rebooked me for flights that are not possible for me to take. I needed to be in Tampa by 9 AM on 9/27.  

The last representative I spoke with just said that she was sorry and for me to try again the next time they have the promotion for the companion pass.  Told me I would need to take the flights they assigned or I would need to cancel and get a refund.  When I said, I only have 10 minutes between the flight lands and the flight that leaves, she told me I would just have to hurry to get to my return flight.

1f1ryyd,2024-08-27 00:07:29,Companion Pass - Optimal Steps to Ensure Seat for Companion,"Hi Everyone,

Read through a series of threads on the topic but want to 100% confirm my understanding.

Took advantage of the SW Promotion where a companion pass would be earned after an initial flight to Hawaii for travel dates 6/1/24 - 7/31/24.

This has been completed.

Companion pass will then be active for flights between 10/5/24 - 11/15/24 where the pass itself will populate within my account sometime on 10/5/14 (from what I‚Äôve gathered reading posts here).

In an effort to secure seats for my companion and I ahead of time for travel dates in November 2024, it sounds like the following steps are the best process:

1) Purchase a round-trip ticket for myself for the November flight prior to the pass going active

2) Purchase a second round-trip ticket for the companion referencing the flight details of the first ticket I bought using the fare type ‚ÄúAnytime‚Äù prior to the pass going active

3) When the companion pass is earned 10/5/24ish, call SW to assist in assigning the Companion Pass voucher to the ‚ÄúAnytime‚Äù ticket which will then be refunded

Do these steps sound correct? 

It also seemed like an alternative option was to cancel the ‚ÄúAnytime‚Äù ticket manually and quickly jump in and book another ticket backfilling the vacancy with the companion pass but read that some people ran into issues doing this

If I cancel *just my flight* (he keeps his): 

1) Does the travel credit he used during booking get reinstated to his account? (Or because the flight was booked with travel credit from a previouly cancelled flight, it gets forfeited? The website policy is unclear*).

And 2): If the travel credit does get reinstated, is it still under my name? Meaning he can only use it to book a future flight for me? Or can he use that credit for himself/others?

I just changed my companion. The info has two errors - the rapid rewards number is not correct and the gender is incorrect. 

I don't think there was a place for me to enter the rapid rewards number. 

I called support. The woman told me the number listed was an old customer number associated with my companion's name. 

If she made the change, it would count as one of my companion pass changes for the year. If I emailed customer service, they could make the change for me without it counting against my three changes for the year. 

1. Is there any way to make this update and correct the companion details online?

She had her roller bag, a tote bag and her CPAP. We told her it‚Äôs a CPAP and she said it still counts towards the limit of 2. I clarified that it‚Äôs a *medical device* (in case she didn‚Äôt know what CPAP means), and she said it still counted towards the limit. 

I kept staring her in the eyes and emphatically saying ‚Äúno, it doesn‚Äôt‚Äù each time. After the third time, she shrugged and literally said ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and shrugged. 

We boarded and started getting settled in a row by another FA and I mentioned to her that her colleague seemed to be unaware that medical devices don‚Äôt count and she may want to remind her of that to avoid issues with other passengers in the future. This other FA said she‚Äôd have to check their manual to see whether that‚Äôs the case. What? 

At least she didn‚Äôt try to make us consolidate them. 

Obviously, the gate agent said nothing (appropriately), but how on earth are any FAs not aware of how medical devices are treated on SW? Let alone two of them on the same flight. They‚Äôre both middle-aged so I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôre veterans, but maybe one or both are actually new.


Updates:

First, I can‚Äôt believe that some people here say we‚Äôre in the wrong or foolish for not checking roller bags when we didn‚Äôt have to check luggage. Just wow!

1g50scl,2024-10-16 22:31:50,Expensive early bird!,"I am flying from BWI to San Juan for work (yeah, rough life, but I'll be at a conference the whole time). The bad part is they won't cover early bird, which I always get for personal travel because I need an aisle seat. I just checked the early bird option and it's $30 each way! Has anyone found this price before? I've never paid more than $20 each way, and this would be $60 out of pocket for a work trip, so I'm hesitant to shell out the bucks for it. 

I used to get medical preboard because I have a tendency toward blood clots and need an aisle seat to make sure I can get up and walk around. That's mostly under control with medication, so I stopped the medical pre-board because I was tired of the stink eye from other passengers as well as the gate agents who grilled me about my medical needs even though I had a legit condition. I still need the aisle seat because I have sciatica and get claustrophobic in middle or window seats, so I started doing early bird to ensure I got a seat that worked for me. So for this trip, should I brave the stink eye and do medical pre-board (blood clots are still a thing, and it's a 4-hour flight), suck it up and pay the $60, or do the 24 hour check-in and hope for a good boarding position?

1fp4lm3,2024-09-25 21:35:11,Boarding Fun - Seating Solutions,"As someone who started flying Southwest within the past five years, I've enjoyed the opportunities to participate in  boarding processes for many flights and observe many others.

I'm just a passenger (with some miles/points) and don't work for SWA so none of this is anything ""official"". Just some scratches on a paper combining best practices and accounting for the reality of travel via the airlines.

Given my travel experiences over the past years with other airlines and being an analytical person, I see a few opportunities that might satisfy the concerns about the pre-boarding issues along with the need to turn a plane quickly.

A scenario of back to front, window, middle, aisle seating generally provides the quickest boarding so I've worked that into my solution.

I realize this is a wall of text so here is a TLDR - 

Pre-boarding passengers are assigned to the last few rows of the plane;
Tight connections up front;
Gaps in boarding numbers to help with last minute passengers with tight connections.

First, the pre-boarding concerns...

This falls outside the scope of ""fast boarding"" and ""quick turn"" type planning because it's a relatively unknown factor until the passengers show up at the gate.

The pre-boarding process of allowing extra time to board seems to meet the requirements of the various regulations related to the ADA (and other similar rules/regulations) so that part probably is good however, inserting some logic into the process may help resolve the concerns about pre-boarding passengers taking the ""prime"" seating which if you look at the rules is likely ""beyond the limits of reasonable accommodations"". The contract of carriage already doesn't guarantee a specific seat, it just says that they will get you from point ""A"" to point ""B"". It also allows the airline to assign specific seats as needed. This is what the other carriers do already so there isn't any sort of novel different if SWA implements these changes.

The change here is that pre-boarding passengers are seated towards the rear of the plane... 

This has a few advantages... It gets them thru the front of the plane faster which allows an extra minute or two to start normal boarding. Also, those passengers are closer to the restroom and the flight attendants can be closer to them should they need assistance.

Also, since wheel chairs tend to take time to arrive, rather than clogging up the deplaning process, they can be seated comfortably while everyone else can deplane.

You would also include customers of size in this pre-boarding process and encourage them to head towards the rear of the plane where there is generally more room.

Next, you configure the seating process so that those with tight connections (less than say 90 minutes) are automatically assigned ""low A"" seating numbers (say A16-30 or even 45). This might mean that there are gaps in the numbers automatically assigned so that late booking customers who have connections can be accommodated towards the front of the plane (if they want). There might also be more than 60 in the ""C"" group.

This would result in a ""block"" of seats (say first five to seven rows) that would be the ""tight connection rows"" and allow these passengers to be the first off the plane instead of having to wade thru the crowd from the back of the bus.

This seems to solve for most of the concerns including benefiting the business travelers who could be attracted to the airline with its more flexible scheduling and seating processes. I think it might also cut down on the pre-boarding abusers as there is zero incentive for someone to pre-board if they don't truly need the extra time.

""At the end of the day, we are going to treat Elliott like any other investor. We'll sit down and listen to them.... Southwest is a great company. We have a great plan and will execute.""

...

Jordan said the Elliott plan ""is fairly light"" on proposed changes. He added that he had heard Elliott could propose bag fees but Southwest said its customer data shows that nearly 50% of its customers pick the airline because of its no-bag fee policy.

""You've got to be very informed before you start proposing changes that affect the business model of Southwest Airlines,"" Jordan said. ""Elliott is not directing the company.""

Jordan told reporters the airline would not stagnate, reiterating Southwest is considering changes to its open seating policy and potentially adding premium seating or extra leg room seats.

""If customer preference tells us we need to evolve, we will evolve. You cannot be stubborn about change,"" Jordan said.

""At the same time we're going to stick to our values and our values say, 'We treat people right. We have the best policies, we have the best people, we operate well' - outside of that everything could be on the table.""",RetroTimeLady,97,258,SouthwestAirlines

1cwfk75,2024-05-20 21:27:14,I was just trying to help I swear!,"Flight from DEN to PHX yesterday afternoon.

It is a completely full flight and I am A56.  The dude ahead of me was a grumpy boomer with an overstuffed roll on. 

We had a slight delay of 10 minutes for a minor mechanical issue.  I saw this dude before we lined up standing over by the walkavator tapping his foot impatiently like having a safe aircraft is a huge problem for him.  The pilots easily made up the 10 minutes in the air but whatever.

So we start boarding and he is A55.  Enter the cabin and of course the first 5-6 rows are completely full except for an aisle seat on row 3.  All the overhead compartments in this area are shut which means they are full of luggage.

This guy starts ripping open those full compartments trying to find a space for his barely legal carry on while huffing and puffing.  He even opens one that is clearly full and tries to shove his big ass bag in there even though there is clearly no chance it will fit.

People in the seats around him are just looking on and trying to comprehend how this fully grown human is having a fit over a lack of compartment space at the front of the plane on a 100% full flight.

Meanwhile the entire line to board is at a complete standstill while this guy freaks out in the aisle.  Finally he just turns and stares at me for a few awkward moments.  

So calmly I say ""If the bins are closed it means they are full"".  So then this guy grabs his luggage, heaves it over his head, and marches back towards the rear of the plane and chucks it in an empty bin.  He turns around and stomps his way back to the front and plops himself in the aisle seat.

I'm like trying to hold in my laughter at this point.  I kinda lose it though when the lady who was sitting right behind the boomer started cracking up.  If you're in this sub and you had the air pods you're a hero.

I had tears of laughter by the time I made it to the back of the plane where I usually sit.  Just a ridiculous outburst from a ridiculous person.",ekranoplan1985,84,270,SouthwestAirlines

1g2rc28,2024-10-13 22:49:52,So Disappointed in My Recent Experience. ,"My husband and I recently flew Southwest from ABQ New Mexico to PIT Pennsylvania. I've always talked about how great Southwest is and how much I appreciate them, but this past experience has been unacceptable. 

Our flight was set to leave at 7:10am. We had a decent 3 hour layover to get to our connecting flight, so when the flight was delayed because of mechanical issues, I wasn't too nervous. But then it got delayed longer, so I went in the line to check with the staff to be sure we're still okay to make our connection. They said we should be fine. And then it wasn't fine. Then we had to deboard and I waited in line AGAIN for over an hour and a half to get rescheduled on other flights. They were telling us we could get on a flight to Phoenix then to Chicago, then stay the night in Chicago because a flight to PIT wasn't available til morning. Also, none of our baggage would have made it with us because that option for the flight was leaving in 5 minutes. We didn't want that option because it sounded horrendous and the staff at the counter said they were going to ""make a note"" saying they offered us a solution and we declined.

Excuse me???¬ø¬ø¬ø Is that a threat? Getting in late and getting in without any of our luggage is NOT a solution. They said they couldn't get us a hotel in New Mexico because there weren't any available rooms, which is a total lie, they just didn't want to pay 500$ a night because of the balloon festival. They wanted to make us travel 12 hours to Chicago and pay 90$ and still get in a day late. 

Increasing the amount of travel time/layover by a significant amount and not having any of our luggage due to their own issues should not be thrown in our faces as if we were being unreasonable in declining their help. 

We opted for a flight the next morning instead because why would we travel all day and not get to our destination anyway til the next day. No, they didn't pay for us to stay anywhere. Oh, and our suitcase got cracked and we didn't even fly anywhere. It was our first time using the new suitcase because we bought it in New Mexico while we were staying there.

The next day we were set to take off at 6:40am. We get on board and guess what? Another mechanical issue on the plane. Then, they announced us to deboard. I started CRYING. Ughhh I couldn't help it. I silently cried into my husband's shoulder like a child. I'm freaking 30 and just couldn't stop. 

They started rebooking our flights without even asking us if it was okay. I got a text saying we were rebooked to go to TWO different cities for a layover. Then somehow the mechanics did the paperwork and we were able to leave at a decent time to make our one connecting flight to get home. We were then rebooked for our original flight and barely made it to the next plane, but at least we made it. And then on our connecting flight, there was ANOTHER MECHANICAL ISSUE. They had to change the wheel on the plane. 

Holy heck. How can there be THIS many issues with all the planes. Was it bad luck? Were other planes having issues like this too? Were inspections on the planes not done before people even board??? Do they not have backup planes in the airports for this exact reason?? 

It was a hell of a trip and I don't want to go anywhere anytime soon for a very long time. I loved Southwest, but this was just too much. I don't want a stupid food voucher, I want them to make this right. I'm so disappointed in how they handled this and I don't blame any of workers, I know they're just doing the best they can, but one of them acted like we were crazy not to take the 12 hour travel trip when we originally had a 5ish hour travel trip because she's ""been working here for over 20 years"" and would ""take that option if I were you"".

1eqbtk8,2024-08-12 20:00:46,"Never Thought I‚Äôd Say This, But I‚Äôm Ready for Assigned Seats","I fly Southwest often and they‚Äôve always been my favorite airline. When I heard the news recently that they‚Äôd be moving towards assigned seats, I was bummed and didn‚Äôt like it. However, after my recent flights this weekend, I‚Äôm ready to accept change. I flew from MSY-HOU-PHX and back. It was my first Southwest flights since the announcement and since May.

First off, is obviously the preboard issue. I won‚Äôt get into it and save everybody‚Äôs time because we all know what I‚Äôm referring to. That‚Äôs never changed.

Second, it‚Äôs annoying when I pay extra and still don‚Äôt get my seat of choice which happens quite often. At least if I paid extra with assigned seats, I‚Äôd be guaranteed that seat. Say MCE on AA or Comfort+ on Delta. Even paying extra for EB leads to a stressful boarding experience sometimes because of the uncertainty of what seats might be available (or worse, saved).

Which leads me to my next point which is seat saving. Something I noticed this weekend which stood out. People placing their items in empty seats making them look open from a distance, only to get to the row and the whole row is ‚Äúsaved.‚Äù It‚Äôs really annoying.

Then there‚Äôs the people who play dumb during boarding. Flying back yesterday from HOU-MSY, I had B1. As A31-60 was still boarding, these three adults get denied boarding because they‚Äôre in B group. So then they stand at the podium and the Ops agent tells them they need to go stand by the signs. So they all come and stand right in front of me at the beginning of B group. When I saw what number they had, they were at the end of B1-30, so basically cut everyone else. I didn‚Äôt make a fuss, but that stuff really pissed me off. That and the people who try to boarding ahead with their party when they have A, but the rest of their party has B or C group.

Lastly, on my completely full PHX-HOU flight there was a couple who was some of the last passengers to board. I was at the window and an older woman was on the aisle. Only middle seats were left. This couple asks the older woman if she could switch to another row because they wanted to sit together. So the older lady offers to move and the couple sits next to me. That annoyed me and I know families with kids also do this same thing.

So at this point, I‚Äôm glad to be moving to assigned seats. Will it be different? Yes. I‚Äôll definitely miss one seating because it all I‚Äôve ever known on Southwest. However, the way other people behave and how they try to cheat the system will hopefully improve the boarding experience and I‚Äôm all for it. I can tell the crews are getting tired of other people‚Äôs nonsense. Just my two cents.",kgaviation,400,1242,SouthwestAirlines

Given I bought the flights at a great price, and we‚Äôre now just a week from Christmas, I didn‚Äôt expect to see anything that would be worth making the adjustment.

But apparently, Southwest changed my original flight‚Äôs departure time by just 10 minutes. Because of that change, they now give me TWO free changes.  No need to fork over more cash, points, or anything.

1fukwg8,2024-10-03 00:48:41,I was under impression that when flying international had to go to international check in line (for me this is BWI typically),"At BWI there is a domestic check in area and a separate area with international check in.   I have always stood in the international line any time I am traveling internationally (I go often to Costa Rica).  Sometimes SW has direct flight but this time of year is low season and I have to connect in Florida.

Still I have always stood in this international line which sometimes can be long and slow and there is no A-list priority option.

I happened to be lookign at the A-list priorty perks and there is a link to participating airports with A-list priority lines.  Under BWI I see the following.

This implies that I would NOT have to go to the international line if I am going to Costa Rica but connecting in Florida.   Can someone confirm this is correct?   I always felt like the internation desk needed to see/scan passport to start an international trip even if first leg is domestic.

So I hopped onto a same day change flight because my meetings wrapped up early. Last one to board on a 3/4 full flight. I‚Äôm walking down the aisle and I see a solo traveler in the window seat with items set on both the middle and aisle seats. I asked if they belonged to her and if she was holding the seat and responded they were not hers and have been there since she boarded (row 10, so early boarder) and that they may have been left from a prior passenger. So I sit, consolidate the items to the middle seat, and ring the FA button to alert of the items.

After a few minutes an off duty FA come up to me and says ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre the one stealing my seat!‚Äù Thinking she was joking I was like ‚Äúhaha yeah I think someone left their stuff here‚Äù to a response from the FA, now very sour, says ‚Äúno that‚Äôs my stuff! I‚Äôm so tired of yall asking for my help when someone moves your shit but you just feel entitled to move mine‚Äù I was kind of blown back by this and said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs against policy to reserve seats, especially TWO seats as you have done but happy to give you the seat and I‚Äôll go elsewhere‚Äù she respond ‚Äújust give me my stuff and I‚Äôll sit in the back‚Äù note she has a very nasty attitude. I hand her her items and she bends over or something and spill over half a glass of liquid all over me! I mean my pants were soaked. 

She looks at me, smirks, and starts to say something along the lines of that‚Äôs what you get but stops and says ‚Äúit‚Äôs just water, you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù and walks off. No sorry or anything!

Another flight attendant that was on duty comes up and apologizes and offers a free drink, which I appreciated.

The Mods have been getting a few reports regarding one of our community members and their posting habits. I'm not interested in naming names, scroll through the sub, and you'll figure it out. 

We try to let this community manage itself as much as possible. I believe that our handling of preboard posts demonstrates that we try not to overreach. There's a sweet spot between allowing hateful speech to persist and holding a community to a higher standard. We try to live in that spot. It ain't easy, and we aren't always successful. 

But back to the Redditor in question. Spam is hard to define. Their posts are frequent, and seem to be have a lot of focus on Southwest's upcoming change in their seating policy. They aren't (that I am aware of) using hateful language, trashing the place with memes, or repeating themselves beyond topic of discussion. As such, we don't really see a reason to ban this user. We DID recently ban a user who was posting memes with foul language and using an aggressive tone within the community. 

That said, there are plenty of tools at your disposal. Use the downvote option to blast them into oblivion, and more importantly, stop engaging. To borrow a jingle from the Simpsons, ""Just don't look, just don't look."" If you stop engaging their response is bad behavior based on a need for attention, we will address it. 

In the meantime, we will continue reviewing reports of abuse and violations of the rules. Should you decide to engage, please remain above reproach. Don't stoop to targeted harassment.

17tbsvd,2023-11-12 11:43:34,Pre-boarders sitting in exit row.,"Traveled from MCO to MDW on Saturday 11/11.

Typical pre-boarders in wheel chairs etc.  We noticed there was a lady boarding with 3 adults.  When we entered the plane, 2 of the pre-boarders were sitting in the exit rows.  One was in the 2 seat row and the other guy was in the seat without a seat in front of it.  We were probably the 7th and  8th boarders so it‚Äôs not like there were many people ahead of us. 

The 2 people in front of us notified the FA that they were pre-boarders and she basically ignored them and said she would handle it.  They pushed back because they wanted that row. She finally told the guy to move. 

The other guy stayed in his seat with the extra room and even though passengers told the FA he pre boarded, she wouldn‚Äôt tell him to move.  But she kept saying she would handle it. 

When boarding was almost done, the FA finally told the pre boarder he had to change seats.  He basically changed seats with the guy behind him.  

Unfortunately the tall guy who really wanted that seat did not get the opportunity to grab it.  He would have been able to sit in it if the FA refused to let the pre-boarder sit in it in the first place. 

I‚Äôve never seen this happen before.  Maybe the FA was new and didn‚Äôt know how to handle the situation.  All she had to do was check their boarding passes.",TotheBeach2,68,181,SouthwestAirlines

there was a mother and her baby, and her mother, so mom, baby, and grandma. i heard the mom say that the baby was only a few weeks old. the mom boarded first w the baby, then grandma followed a few minutes later. once i got on the plane i noticed that they were in row 7, mom+baby in carrier in aisle seat and grandma in the window. there had to have been at least half the plane empty behind them. full rows, seats at ur heart‚Äôs desire! FA‚Äôs were encouraging people to space out since the flight was pretty empty. then the man in front of me stops at the row with the 2 women and the baby and asks for their middle seat. the mom holding the baby kinda looked at him like ‚Äúreally?‚Äù and the people sitting in the rows around had the same expressions. but he insisted and she ended up asking if he‚Äôd be ‚Äúokay‚Äù with the aisle seat so she could at least be next to her mother. *HE* had the audacity to be like ‚Äúyeah fine‚Äù over an aisle seat in a row he really didn‚Äôt need to sit in. 

i‚Äôd understand if it was a full flight and he wanted to be close to the front but the row behind them was completely empty. it was so strange and i felt bad for the 2 women; the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù mom clearly had been stressed and overwhelmed with flying w a newborn and finally seemed settled in their seats until he came along. plus this whole ordeal held up the rest of the boarding. like come on dude, move it.

1fphng0,2024-09-26 06:50:28,Are Southwest Points Value Fixed?,"With many airlines, when buying tickets with points, the point cost is in increments.  Like 2,500 point increments for example. So there's never a fixed consistent conversion of cost of the ticket in dollars to points. For example on Alaska Air, the cost in points for $200 ticket might be 10,000 points sometimes, 12,500 other times, and 15,000 points other times when the ticket price has not changed in dollars.

I noticed on Southwest which I don't fly often but have some points, the point values are very specific/odd numbers.  This leads me to believe Southwest has a consistent formular to convert dollar cost to point cost.  Is that true?  Or does the point cost for a ticket vary sometimes even if the dollar cost has stayed the same?

If the latter is true, what is considered a good use points when converting from dollars?  It looks like it's 65 points per $1 (plus a small surcharge).  ",BeingBalanced,12,3,SouthwestAirlines

1csv14y,2024-05-16 04:33:08,"Tired of wasting money on ""upgrades""","Sometimes I just want my family to be guaranteed to sit together on a flight. Earlier this year, Ibought the early bird for each of us both ways, but between the massive groups of preboarders, business select, a-list, etc., the plane was half full when we boarded, with no empty rows for the three of us.

On the next trip with just me and my wife, I wanted to be able to sit in a better seat near the front, so I purchased business select. The first 6-7 rows were taken by preboarders and their entourages when we got on. It was fine, but definitely not worth the premium. On the way back, there wasn't a huge group of preboarders and we had A1 and A2, so I figured it would finally pay off. When boarding started, a group of maybe 10 people just took off in front of us. We knew they couldn't possibly have better positions and we figured that the gate attendant would make them get in line properly, but she just sent them through ahead of us. When we got on on board, the front rows were again occupied already and, since it was not a very full flight on a -800 plane, zone boarding was in effect for balance and we were forced to sit past the emergency row. To top it all off, the free drink included in the ticket never came because turbulence cancelled the drink service (understandable, but not pleasant given the circumstances)

Southwest used to be my favorite airline, especially since I am tall and SW's seat pitch is better than most. I used to see other airline's premium seat strategies as a money grab, but at least you get what you pay for. With SW these days, the upgrades don't give you much of an edge given that there is no enforcement to thwart the seat-savers, line-skippers, and excessive preboard groups. I have now started to book on other airlines, usually paying more for economy seats because I see the value in having an assigned seat. I'll only fly SW now if I am flying alone and I don't care what seat I get.

1dpuesp,2024-06-27 23:44:02,Denied for preboarding | Change in Southwests Policy?,"I fly Southwest pretty regularly. I recently flew DEN-CLT and was denied preboarding. I was B30, but I request preboarding so I can sit in the aisle seat in either row 1 or 2. I have severe neuropathy in my left leg, and I struggle walking down the center aisle on most planes unless they're the larger planes for international travel, but I can't tell you how many times I've fallen and gotten hurt trying to walk down the aisle in smaller planes.

The Gate Agent took one look at me and said no when I went up to speak to her about preboarding. When I told her I needed a specific seat, she just rolled her eyes and said I was denied. I told her that in that case, I would like to request the aisle chair to take me to an open seat so I would not have to walk down the aisle and she told me that is only offered for non-ambulatory flyers. I know this is not true, as I have used the aisle chair in the past. I wasn't flying with my wheelchair, just my rollator, as I was flying to see my mom, and I have a wheelchair at her house and I don't use one every day.

I was lucky that when I boarded, there was an aisle seat open in row 3 somehow, but has Southwest's policy changed? Or did I just encounter a bad Gate Agent? Part of why I always pick Southwest is their customer service has always been above and beyond what I am used to, with such friendly and helpful employees. And since I was denied, does this mean on my return flight home CLT-DEN later I will also be denied?

  
EDIT: Just wanted to add an edit to say that I have filed a complaint with the DOT and spoken with SW's Accessibility Department on the phone to have a complaint registered. They've assured me that there has been no change in SW's policy, and that the gate agent in question will be investigated for not following SW's policies or the laws surrounding disability access. They assured me that this will have no impact on my ability to preboard on my return flight. ",callmebreanainn,219,255,SouthwestAirlines

Anyways, because I travel a lot I usually try to sit in the first 5 rows of the plane. The majority of my flights are less than 2 hours so I really don't care if I'm in a middle seat or not. I would rather sit in the middle of row one instead of window / aisle in row two. I know it sounds silly but since I fly all the time I want to spend as little time on the plane as possible (even if it is like 15 seconds less). I just want to be as close to the door as possible so I can get off the plane and on with my life.

Usually I'm between A15 and A20 so it's not an issue, but if I try to sit in a seat and someone says ""this seat is saved,"" I sit there anyway. I dont care. If they have a coat or something on the seat I pick it up and hand it to them. If they make a fuss, I turn on my music and ignore them. Eventually they stop and I go on with my life. It has never escalated to a flight attendant so I can't comment there.

TLDR: I dont care about your ""saved seat"" and I'm sitting there wether you like it or not. If you don't like that, pay to get a better boarding position than me.

Getting through security was fast and easy and I wasn't singled out for anything. I checked my luggage and it arrived to my destination with everything in it and didn't take an hour.

There weren't 50 preboarders and no small children on the flight, probably due to the to time of year. All of the preboaders were elderly people in wheelchairs.

No one fought over seats because the flight was still 1/3 empty. I got to sit in a window seat close to the front and I could fit in it comfortably and had plenty of leg room. 

The plan left on time and arrived to the destination early. This was my biggest concern because there was a storm at my destination so I was afraid the flight would be delayed or canceled. But we made it through with ease.

Here are the things I love about being (near) last on the plane:

1.  Less time waiting in plane to taxi out. Instead, everyone waiting on me to find seat and luggage space. 

2. Less choices for overly taxed brain to make. Only two middle seats to choose from. Less stress, more action. 

3. By leaving it up to the Gods to decide my seat mates for flight (because I have no choice or free will to choose seats) more likely to end up next to millionaire looking for good buddy to put in will to inherit estate rather than kids. 

4. By having luggage near back of plane and my seat near middle of plane, have time to converse with friendly FA while Frogger* style moving up row by row as passengers exit plane. 

5. See number four. Sense of completion as I watch most passengers exit as I retrieve bags from back of plane. Get to see all exiting passengers one last time. Meaningful eye contact with each one not possible with A boarding group.

The flight was rescheduled with a slightly later arrival, same departure though, this made some connections in DEN for some people a little tight.  The crew was aware, and about 30 minutes before landing they called out each flight and asked for people on those flights to identify, then told everyone to remain seated while those people got off the plane to make their connections.  That instruction was repeated once we got to the gate, and the passengers COMPLIED!  

During the flight the cabin crew were VERY attentive - several trips down the aisle to collect trash, asked several times if a beverage was needed.  Probably the most attentive crew I've had on a flight.  Also - just after the pre-arrival announcement for the connections they also took people through a bit of a stretching session (it was a nearly 5 hour flight).

GREAT DEN-based cabin crew!!

The flight deck was also informative, spoke about the weather and the strong headwinds we'd be bucking for the flight (causing the delayed arrival compared to the original schedule).

I purchased 20,000 points for $300-thinking I could use it for my total purchase. Turns out I can only get $140 off my purchase of $500...so I spent $300 to ""save"" $140-ugh! Is there anything I can do, or do I just take the loss and lesson learned? I guess I didn't fully understand the Rapids Rewards points system.

Maybe I am lucky and fly with the least egregious groups of people but the most obnoxious thing I experience is the fact that no matter how empty the flight is someone always wants to sit directly next to me. 
The idea that. These flights are going to get more expensive to avoid getting stuck in the middle seat where I will inevitably get no armrest use and probably have someone partially sitting on me from at least one side so that we can have assigned seats is extremely disappointing. I also think it‚Äôs got way more to do with the new stock owners pushing for maximizing profits than it does with people being awful, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be a popular opinion around here either.

1egwutw,2024-08-01 04:02:15,Checking Up on a Complaint Filed Against Another Passenger,"Yesterday morning, my wife and I were trying to get to our spot in line (A2 and A3) when another passenger (A4) became hostile. I wasn‚Äôt entirely aware of what he was upset about, but he stood right behind the A1 passenger and refused to interact with me when I asked him what his number was and told him what ours were.

A few moments later, they called for A1-30 to board, and he pushed me and hit me with his bag trying to block me from moving in front of him. I called for the agent to help, and the agent called a manager over to file a complaint. They took both of our names down and said they would check the security cameras to determine what happened. At that point, the other passenger seemed to realize there were consequences to pushing another person in public and started acting like it was no big deal and a joke. The manager just kept saying they would check the cameras.

Should I wait for an update from Southwest or should I contact customer service or the airport for an update?

Edit: This post has been well answered by this point. Thanks to everyone for their points of view.

To those that seemed to misunderstand, the complaint was about being pushed, not having to board 3rd. I didn‚Äôt understand what the guy was doing and decided to ignore him to my harm. He pushed me and hit me with his bag as I was proceeding as normally as possible, and that‚Äôs what I filed the complaint about. Also, I didn‚Äôt even know this was an option beforehand. When I called for help after being pushed, the gate agent said, ‚ÄúYou should file a complaint. I‚Äôll get a manager.‚Äù

Honestly, if the guy had run in front of me without touching me, I would have still thought he was a weird old man, but I wouldn‚Äôt have had much of a reason to complain, in my opinion. Getting physical with a stranger is not okay, and, even if nothing comes of it, I‚Äôm glad I filed the complaint.",SirDrAaron,204,831,SouthwestAirlines

1ft2si7,2024-10-01 02:29:41,Recent Experience ,"This is a bit of a rant:

I traveled from ATL to ORD this past week. First leg of the trip, had a connection out of Nashville. After an unusually long wait to taxi to the runway, we had to deplane due to some issue. Ok great, glad they determined that before takeoff. They ended up putting us on another aircraft which turned out to be a more comfortable MAX 8 model. I arrived at my destination late, but not the end of the world. Just a minor annoyance at this point.

My return ATL on the other hand is where I really began to doubt Southwest's ability to service it's customers efficiently and with proper care. I board my flight in ORD and am excited it's another MAX 8. Remarkably, I got an emergency exit seat with no one in the middle. We get to the runway, waiting to be cleared for takeoff. We wait, and wait. Finally captain announces they've received notification that a pressure sensor (or gauge. Don't remember exact term) was malfunctioning. He says we have to wait for maintenance to come fix it, but should only take 10-15min once they arrive. How this was overlooked before boarding everyone and making it to the runway is beyond me. So we wait. Periodically, captain comes on regurgitating the same information. I am checking the app because I have a connection in Baltimore. This waiting for maintenance goes on for close to an hour. Finally, I determine I will miss my connection if I stay on the plane. I go to the desk at the gate and am informed I have no other options to get home and would have to wait until the next day. This is at approximately 2:00pm. The person ""helping"" me says they partner with a Comfort Inn and he could get me a room to wait at until morning when the next available flight is. No remorse, no care. I'm not happy, but feel I have no other options. I accept the room voucher and leave the airport. Fast forward 2 hours; I get to the ""hotel"" around 4pm. It's rundown, smells bad and is in what appears to be a questionable part of town. I got to my room and immediately knew I would not be able to sleep there nor even lay on the bed for fear I'd get bed bugs or lice. I didn't even take my shoes off because the carpet looked gross and had the same sour stench as the lobby and hallway. There's a spider on the wall. I left it alone as it's not my job to perform pest control. I contemplate going back to the  airport to wait until 5:45 am when my next flight boards. Knowing I wouldn't get any sleep, I decided I could give it some time to try and rest in the office chair as that was the cleanest furniture in the room. I ordered food delivery and watched a football game because I didn't feel comfortable venturing outside as night approached. I took the first shuttle back to ORD at 4:00am. I wasn't feeling well due to lack of sleep. With all the issues so far, I'm concerned something else will happen and I'll be stuck in this place. All I wanted was to get back to my family who'd just gone through a tropical storm without me. But miraculously, we made it off the ground only a few minutes behind schedule. I'm relieved to be out of there, and on my way to Dallas (Lovefield) where I'll finally be headed home. I ended up with B-50 boarding position based on when the guy checked me in the previous day. It was a packed flight. Not a single open seat. On a 737-700. I ended up stuck between two rather large women near the back of the plane. It was torture for 2.5hours, but I finally made it. 

Couldn't they have at least upgraded my boarding position for the inconvenience? Will the airline compensate me for the extra food and additional day of parking I had to pay due to their negligence? 

This experience has left a very poor impression on me, and won't be looking to travel with Southwest again.

For every SW flight I'm on that serves SW Snack Mix, I count and track the number of Pretzels, Cheese-Its, and crackers (the contents of the packets).

I started this out of frustration that the packets are almost always overwhelmingly pretzels...fyi- I'm not a big fan of pretzels. I started this count on 18Nov2023, on our flight to SJD. This is another example of taking a not so positive experience and having fun with it üòÅ

To date, including today, I have 22 samples (photos) in my data set...the only problem is that, I lose interest pretty quickly after I get off the flight, so I have only entered data from 2 samples...yeah I know...I can be a slacker sometimes...

So, if, like me, you have ever wondered if there are predominantly more pretzels than Cheese-Its and Crackers in the infamous SW Snack Mix packets, rest assured you are absolutely correct.

zyao44,2022-12-30 01:17:58,The Real problem with the Software at Southwest Airlines.,"# From a former Senior Software Engineer at Southwest Airlines that was responsible for fixing, maintaining and keeping the software running that scheduled flights, pilots and crew.

## Why Southwest Airlines is behind in Technology

Senior Middle management is not adopting new innovation and misreporting to C-suite leadership the actual problems with the architecture and software. 100% nontechnical people assessing a technical issue and reporting on the potential customer impact. 

Southwest Airlines thinks of themselves as an Airline first and not a technology company.  In today's world every company needs to be a technology company first or meet the same fate as Blockbuster.  

Southwest has many highly technical developers, cloud architects, Site Reliability Engineers and DevOps Engineers, so talent at the engineering level is not a problem.  It is the non-technical senior and middle management (particularly the ones who have tenure) in the Technology Services and Operations department that destroy any chance to implement best practices, new innovation and new process to improve Southwest's Software and Technical Posture.

## Answer to why this happened 
The application that manages the scheduling of crew members and pilots called Crew, and other apis and services went offline due to its outdated software packages and over utilized server resources aka cpu, memory and disk space. 

The people who are at fault are below and why they are at fault is included. With modern software practices like automating self healing and auto scaling. The applications should have been able to handle any winter storm of any magnitude.

## Directly at fault

**Senior Director Technology Services and Operations at Southwest Airlines**

**Senior Manager Technology Services and Operations at Southwest Airlines**

## Co-conspirator and Enabler

Management that supports his circle of trust to keep things secret and bury issues.

## Why they are at fault

They own the Crew application and other apis and services that caused this chaos and did nothing to prevent this catastrophe by ignoring the recommendations that I and other Software Engineers made to sure up this application's reliability and performance. 

They refused to change antiquated software development processes and practices. They also covered up major software problems, software bugs and ignored performance issues that ultimately led to this disaster.

## Advice to Southwest Airlines

- Digitally Transform so that you can build a Site Reliability team. 
- Fire the Director and Manager listed in this post.
- Don't give the responsibility of keeping systems that are critical to your business in the hands of Directors and Managers who do not want to improve the systems. These managers find excuses to keep things as they are because they are incompetent.
- Talk directly to the engineers
- Create a blameless culture that allows engineers to share new ideas with out the fear of management retaliating.
- Identify the managers who try to punish anyone who tries to share an idea and fire those managers.  Basically, fire the bullies.
- Hire the technical leadership who understand, cloud, incident management, postmortems, MTTR, MTTD, MTTF and the culture that goes with that.

Honestly, I really want Southwest Airlines to succeed, there are really only a few bad apples here that caused this.  I love their culture and most of the people I worked with.  All Southwest Airlines employees want to do the best for the company. It is time for those who don't understand technology to get out of the way of those who do and move on.",MethodElectrical2686,391,1428,SouthwestAirlines

1) The unused balance is not stored in your Southwest account.  You have to enter the gift card number and pin every single time you want to use it.

2) There isn't even anywhere on the Southwest site to check a gift card balance.  You have to pretend you are going to buy a ticket just to see the balance.

Costco has been a very popular place to buy gift cards because you can get $50-$70 off a $500 card depending on if they are running a sale or not.  If you bought your card through Costco and lost the card details and the email with the link, here's how to get the card details:

*Go to:*¬†[*memberedelivery.com*](http://memberedelivery.com/)

*Click on 'Digital Order Portal'*

*Info you'll need is the Costco Order number (which if you don't have it, call the Costco online rep to retrieve it), and also the email you bought the e-giftcard with.*",BeingBalanced,8,0,SouthwestAirlines

Earlier this month I was scheduled to fly from SMF to KON with a 2-hour layover in LAS.  The flight to LAS ended up being delayed due to a problem with a fuel pump sensor.  As the delay continued, passengers were being pulled from the plane and placed on other flights to their destinations.  I wasn't too concerned since we still had plenty of time to make our connection.  

Our flight got delayed even more to the point where I thought we were going to miss our connection.  We were in contact with a flight attendant who was aware of our situation and had asked that the flight to KON be delayed as we weren't the only passengers that needed to be on that flight.

We finally took off almost 2.5 hours after we were scheduled to leave.  I was monitoring our flight and was not sure if we were going to make it based on our arrival time in LAS.  We landed and made our way to the gate for our flight to KON as fast as possible.  Being that we were the last people to get on the plane, I was expecting available seats to be scattered throughout the plane.  

As I entered the plane, one of the flight attendants asked for my name.  She then pointed to the **2nd row** of seats that were taped off with a ""saved"" sign and said that they saved my family a whole row since they knew we were traveling with a minor.

I've been flying Southwest for decades and the majority of the time have had positive experiences.

1flpjjh,2024-09-21 07:25:34,Southwests policy on checking oversize extra bags,"So I normally fly with 6 pelican cases and a carry on, fees usually hit $1k one way but not my money not my problem, my question is what is their official stance on assisting with baggage checking? 

Normally at BWI, Dallas, Denver, and other major airports when they see me they guide me to the nearest attendant who assists with the process.

However today I flew out of Oakland and they made me tag every bag individually with the kiosk, and since they are all oversized they had to then remove all the tags, charge me, and then retag all of my bags. Ended up turning what's normally a 15 minute process into over 45 minutes of confusion. 

I tried explaining to the attendants that kept bouncing me around what was going on but they all dismissed me. One sent me to the help desk that was unmanned, someone finally came up and said I needed to hop in the priority line, so I hopped in priority. They then called me up asked if I was priority and I said no but I needed help with the oversize bags and was sent here and was informed I had to tag them myself and wait in line with the rest of the people.

I don't mind waiting in line mind you, I'm no better than anyone else, it's just out of 50+ flights hauling the same cargo I've never had this happen and it royally screwed my timing as I was of the expectation that I'd get the usual one on one experience with a manager or someone higher up that knew what was going on when it came to people hauling cargo. Instead I got a very flustered person who had no clue what was going on because of my abnormal cargo and I believe my company card got either double charged or triple charged as a result of the confusion so our accountant now has to look into what happened.

If anyone else has some experience with this I'd love to hear it cause today was the weirdest southwest experience I've had out of the normally very predictable process I normally follow.",Dick_In_A_Tardis,7,5,SouthwestAirlines

It‚Äôs not clear to me how people traveling together even get separated like this, but so be it. I make the case that it‚Äôs supposed to be open seating but the family is right behind me, apparently.

I relented the first time but pressed on the second time because there were no other seats together at that point.

I would have thought the ‚Äúextra time down the jetway‚Äù call would have solved this problem.

Regardless, this is frustrating because I don‚Äôt want to cause a scene or get in fights with people. But the difference in this particular case was the last two seats together or 2 middles separated, so it‚Äôs a pretty big difference.

17cqf9u,2023-10-21 08:55:08,Entitled POS escorted off of plane during boarding,"I recently had a plane change at BWI on the way home. As I boarded (A21) I overheard a tense exchange between the guy in the front row aisle seat and the FA. After I settled into my seat I could hear her tell him 'There is no reason for you to talk to me that way'. I don't know what he said, but it was enough for her to get the Captain involved. The guy gave him the same attitude so he went back to the cockpit. I noticed the flow of boarder had stopped and then another employee was telling him that he needed to follow her up the jetway as our flight crew did not feel comfortable flying with him and he would be booked on the next flight. He refused, she said if he did not follow her the police would be called. She disappeared and shortly after someone who said they were the Station Manager had the same conversation with him. He refused and was told that his ticket would be forfeited and SW would not book him on another flight, but called their bluff too.  At that point, The Captain asked us all to deplane but we could leave our bags in the overhead bins. I was tempted to let my backpack smack the back of his head as I passed but settled for saying 'thanks a lot asshole.'  It seemed that the issue was a refusal to put his bag in the overhead since there wasn't a seat in front of him to put it under.

Six members of the ~~Baltimore~~ PD appeared from various directions and escorted Mr. Jerk off the plane. I was surprised that he was not handcuffed. Shortly after we reboarded and were on our way home.  I was impressed with the calm demeanor that all of the staff exhibited while dealing with this jerk. The Captain apologized for the delay and made up as much time in the air as he could so we were only an hour late getting home. I suspect that Mr. Entitled will not be able to book any flights on SW for a while. I do not know what the outcome of his discussion with the BPD was. They were still talking in the adjacent gate as we reboarded.

Why do people put their carry ons in the very first open overhead bin they see, then go several rows back to find a seat? Are the bins not supposed to correspond to the seats below them? It makes it so that there are tons of empty seats towards the front of the plane, but no overhead bin space. So if you want to sit up front, but you have a carry on, you'd have to walk all the way down until you find overhead space, put your bag up, then go against boarding traffic to get to the front to the seat you want. Or just have to grab a seat all the way towards the back.

17p784w,2023-11-07 00:55:47,Why does anyone tolerate CLEAR?,"I understand the value of TSA PreCheck. The revenue it generates goes back into a federal service, it's affordable, it has an obvious (if minor) security benefit via the background check, and it has its own designated lines, removing people who would otherwise be clogging up the All Travelers lines.

CLEAR, on the other hand, is private &amp; for-profit, adds seemingly security benefit at best and makes traveling more dangerous at worst (they've been responsible for numerous unauthorized people accessing secure areas), and allows users to pay to skip the line for regular screening.

TSA agents seem to despise it. Airports (with whom CLEAR splits revenue) love it because it's a money-maker, but I don't know how it doesn't cross so many ethical and operationally sensible lines. ",Evening-Editor-4014,259,252,SouthwestAirlines

I understand some people take advantage of pre-boarding, and this is frustrating. I get it. But the hatred for pre-borders with invisible disabilities is disgusting. 

I have multiple sclerosis. Somedays I can walk, sometimes I can't. Somedays I use a wheelchair or a cane or a walker, somedays I don't have to use a mobility aid. There are times where all of a sudden my legs stop working in the middle of the day. I carry a foldable cane in my bag.

You sometimes wouldn't know this about me. You wouldn't know the amount of medicaiton I take just so I don't become permanently disabled. You wouldn't know that I take monthly infusions. I wouldn't know that every 6 months I have to have MRIs due to my progression. You wouldn't know that I had to basically re-learn how to write and hold items in my hands. 

I'm going to use pre board even when I don't need a wheelchair. Why? Because at any moment, my legs can turn into jello. Stay mad. Complain all you want. But that's not going to stop me. Complain to Southwest. Complain to ya momma and daddy. Judge allll you want.

1ezsknj,2024-08-24 08:37:22,On Board with Assigned Seating,"Well, at first I was skeptical, but now I‚Äôm fully on board with assigned seating. In just one flight this morning, we dealt with 2 incidents. 

First, we witnessed a woman with a C60 boarding pass with a slapped-on knee brace for her ‚Äúinjury‚Äù that required pre-boarding. Her and her partner hopped into line 10 minutes before the first boarding even began (if your knee hurts why are you standing longer than you need to), and they smuggly told A1 passenger that they will have to wait to board until after them. When they called for pre-boarders, she limped her way up. We just got off our flight and guess whose overly-exaggerated limp is gone. 

Also had a family of at least 10 board before A group. They sat right behind the exit row, which is where we like to sit, since my partner is tall and needs the extra leg room. We paid extra for business select and then another $70 for him to be upgraded when we got a companion pass. Not sure why they got to go with pre-boarders, since family boarding is supposed to happen between A &amp; B. We then got kicked the entire time by their kids.

Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt have nice things like open seating because 1. People take advantage of everything and 2. Southwest doesn‚Äôt consistently enforce its own rules. 

On the way out a week ago, I had A1 position for the first time ever and was super excited. Only to be told at the last second that I had to put my neck pillow (that I was immediately going to use for my 6 am flight) into my carryon because it was a personal item. So I got passed up by like 15 people. Either enforce the rules or don‚Äôt, but at least be consistent so people know what to expect.

1ez7i59,2024-08-23 16:25:59,Rant: Southwest CVV error prevented me from booking $29 flight üòñ,"
Sorry - came here to vent. 

Was going to book $29 fare from Oakland to LAX to visit grandparents over Christmas and every time I tried to hit Purchase, the CVV text field would get cleared (and return an error).

By the time I finally got smart enough to enter in a brand new payment method which finally saved the CVV without clearing it out (the blank CVV text box mysteriously disappeared when I added a new card), I literally hit Purchase right as the clock struck midnight, and now get the Fare Unavailable error code.

_____

For any product team members who actually care to fix this:
- Mobile iOS Web
- Logged in
- CVV error was triggered on my saved payment methods, and I was only able to bypass it by entering a brand new payment method (I couldn't use any saved credit cards because I would keep getting asked to reenter my CVV, which I would do, the system would change it to hidden ***, then I'd click Purchase which seemed to create the same CVV error message by clearing the CVV box.

If I didn't know any better, you'd think they created this error on purpose to prevent others from purchasing the $29 fare because they realized their flights were about to get overbooked and the crazy Southwest system failure meltdown of 2022 was going to happen all over again...

NOTE: I only got smart enough to take screenshots once I realized what was happening, in hopes that Southwest customer service would be able to help me (they didn't and claimed they couldn't). But I was trying to make this purchase for a good 15-20 min before I realized the clock was ticking down! Thus, the CVV error screenshot was on my 5th try. The last screenshot shows that the $29 fare is STILL being advertised way past midnight even though those fares no longer exist. False advertising üò°.",Snoo_53622,16,0,SouthwestAirlines

zxeml3,2022-12-29 00:57:51,Southwest will be spending quite a lot of money on branding salvage efforts in 2023. Don't buy into it.,"Because this post has gained a little bit of traction, I‚Äôm gonna place a disclaimer at the front. If you are a SWA pilot, flight attendant, gate agent, baggage handler, ticket counter agent, or anyone outside the C-suite, you have my undying thanks for the excellent experiences onboard for the past 19 years. This is not directed at you in any way shape or form, and I always found your service to be outstanding even under challenging circumstances. You unfortunately have been expected to perform at a high level with broken and outdated tools, and were blamed first by your leadership when things went wrong. We‚Äôve seen the DEN memo and it breaks our hearts to see good people talked to like that in the middle of a deadly winter storm. 

I also don‚Äôt hope for the airline to fail. It‚Äôs extremely unlikely that there will be permanent consequences for the inaction of the executive board, and the airline will exist in one form or another long after this meltdown has been forgotten. 

This mostly comes from my professional rage toward inept, incompetent MBA executives that are all too common in always-on industries like transportation. Ideally, I would very much enjoy if the executives would man the phones and stop spending every hour on the clock crafting corpospeak PR messages that promise nothing, admit nothing, and ultimately do nothing but attempt and fail at damage control. 

Hey Mr. Jordan - people have been sleeping on the floor for days on end and have had to shell out hard earned money to keep themselves warm and their families safe, nobody gives a flying fuck about your brand image right now. Nobody cares about your values, your commitment, your faux-apologies. Man a phone or answer CS emails, and log out of Twitter until this is over. While you‚Äôre at it, load a bag, recover an aircraft, and show up for gate agent duty. Get some perspective and get out of the way.

This is a perfect storm for their branding, no pun intended.

Christmas is THE American holiday for families. NYE and 4th of July are great, but they don't see anywhere close to the travel volume that Christmas does. Families are traveling together, going to see grandma in the hospital, traveling to see the newborn, getting together in nature or the city, whatever the case may be. Most of my happy memories from childhood are centered around the Christmas holiday, and I think that goes for many others as well.

Southwest has not shot themselves in the foot. They've blown the leg clean off with double-aught buckshot, and blamed their workers and the weather for it. Now, the only action the public can perceive is that the airline is scrambling to minimize its liability. This is a pure lose-lose situation for them, no matter what they do- they had repeated opportunities to upgrade or acquire new scheduling software, which is the ENTIRE source of the problem.

Denver and a couple of other airports did have some weather delays, but looking at the data that would have been in keeping with other cancellations at the same airport. Half of the DEN baggage handling crew reportedly walked off the job- not a strike, not a walkout. 50% of the crew quit on the spot. SW swears up and down that it isn't true, but the leaked internal memo suggests otherwise. They were willing to pry into people's lives and redefine what constituted a medical absence in order to force people into working in an arctic storm.

Consumers may have few choices in the airlines they fly on, but people aren't gonna forget this one. This isn't an isolated situation with an irate passenger or a localized labor issue. This is a systemic core meltdown of a system that their employees have been begging for years to be replaced.

When your Christmas memories include having to sleep on an airport floor with your kids, you won't forget that when you go to look for flights next year. When you had to shell out $500 to keep your family clothed and warm because your checked bags are gone, you won't forget. When you had to walk 2 miles through the snow to your hotel because rental cars were booked out and Lyft/Uber's surge pricing quoted a $75 ride, you won't forget.

This is the essence of American corporate failure- operating an always-on service with minimal staffing, bland wages and benefits, and outdated tools while expecting maximum efficiency and profit.  This is usually followed by the C-suite blaming everyone but themselves and their shit culture and management decisions.

I've flown Southwest for 19 years almost exclusively, and will be cutting up my cards and moving on to Delta. To fail at Christmas, at the height of travel season with a system the C-suite was unwilling to fix, is unacceptable. Take your dollars elsewhere, and turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the horseshit they're going to pump out to try and repair their reputation.

It's genuinely sad for me to see this airline go down like this. I have fond memories of being on their planes as a kid with funny flight attendants, you felt like you were entertained. I flew on SW for the last time on December 22nd, and the attendants looked exhausted, sullen, and stressed. First time I'd ever seen that with any of their crew, and I've taken about 120 flights over the past few years. The quality of their support staff has taken a nosedive due to what I'm sure are cost cutting efforts, and the recently implemented points restrictions and blackout dates, even to their high status fliers, are a total slap in the face.

It was fun while it lasted. Yet another unique American airline experience ruined by incompetent MBAs.",KinoTele,221,553,SouthwestAirlines

I was rebooked for a flight three days later. The agent told me that I could submit a reimbursement claim for food and transportation. I had family in the area, but the original flight took off with my luggage. I had family a hour away that picked my son and I up from the airport, so I only purchased $159 worth of food and necessities for my son and I. As of now, Southwest said that they would only reimburse $25, which is the amount I paid for gas. I sent them another ticket to ask for an explanation, and I also detailed the cancelled trip, my expenses, and attached the receipts again. I hope that will be taken care of. As for the flight being rebooked three days out, am I entitled to a refund or just luv vouchers?  I couldn't find my answers on the DOT website. What should I expect?

edit: Both legs of my return flight took off at the ETA time. There were no weather delays or anything. The agent could not confirm why my flight was cancelled.

second edit: The flight was from Richmond airport to Seattle with a Denver layover. I was text that my flight was cancelled. I had been waiting at the gate for a hour with my son. I had checked it and my luggage was checked. Everybody going to Seattle received the same text. All of the other passengers still left with the plane. I asked the agent if they could get my luggage back, and they said it was too late to do that. My luggage ended up in Seattle that night, and they held it for me.

The Check In agent said it was SW policy for all the boxes to be unsealed and inspected.  These were Home Depot Large Boxes, all weighing 48-50 lbs.  Luckily, they only looked through the top 5 to 8 inches of each box, and had tape for us to reseal the boxes.  They were very polite and prodessional throughout.  Lesson learned is to lightly seal the box, have them inspect, and then go crazy with the tape after they have put the bag tags on.

Transporting kid to college across the country via SWA with a plane change. Packing all dorm stuff in Home Depot moving boxes within size and weight restrictions and taping it up really well.  3 pax = 3 boxes plus 3 suitcases. Out carry ons will have our clothes and essentials for the three day trip. 
Someone told us that we need to make sure we DO NOT seal the boxes shut as they need to get inspected, but to bring tape to the airport.

([https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/17qrv2p/i\_havent\_flown\_in\_35\_years\_is\_this\_bag\_allowed\_as/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/17qrv2p/i_havent_flown_in_35_years_is_this_bag_allowed_as/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))  Well, I took the flight and I thought some people might be interested in an update on how it went, so here it is.

First off, I did take the bag on as a carry-on and all went well on that (more on that later). A few people were commenting on how flying had changed in the past 35 years and gave some advice as to what to do. . My wife decided that she wanted to drive down there with me to deliver my daughter her car so there were 2 of us going thru this experience.  We were leaving from Nashville and I found going thru security at BNA extremely easy.  The lines at the full body x-ray were getting long so they let a bunch of us go thru the old fashioned x-ray, but my wife has an artificial knee so she had to go thru the full body one. She had forgotten to take her phone out of her pocket so she got delayed there a bit but it wasn‚Äôt too bad. Getting to the gate was easy-peasy. I had taken the advice of getting the early-bird and I was glad that we did it. Our early bird got us boarding positions in the A50 group. That‚Äôs important because the flight back to Chicago was full and they were warning everyone with a C boarding pass they had to check any rolling cases as the overheads would be full. When we got on, I was able to fit my old case in the overheads and our backpacks and her purse were under the seats. By the time the B groups were getting on, about halfway thru, the overheads were full and they started having to check anything that wouldn‚Äôt fit under the seats. Flight was a full flight and I was glad to have boarded early to have my wife have a window seat (she gets claustrophobic when on a plane and needs a window so she can look out, even at night) and I sat in the middle next to her. 

Flight left on time and arrived at Midway on time. Then came our next adventure as I had to get back to my home in the burbs. I had never used UBER so this was another 1st for me, but that was pretty easy, especially with the fact that I found someone to help me navigate the UBER app. Ordered my UBER, went outside to the proper spot and the ride showed up and I got home. Big thanks to that random guy I found and I hope that party for his ex-girlfriend he was going to ended up great. 

Anyway I say all of this to thank you all for your help. I was nervous about this trip and it all went great thanks to what I found out here.

1fdot2w,2024-09-11 02:17:09,The Little Airline That Couldn‚Äôt,"After flying SWA almost since its birth, and racking up 1.2 million flier miles, I‚Äôm flying g United today along my regular route, CMH to DEN. United because I‚Äôm going on to Hawaii. 

Today on United, I ( without ‚Äústatus‚Äù of any kind) experienced a calm orderly boarding. Exactly two medical preboards for a 737-800, mostly full. No jostling, seat saving or line jumping. Lots of overhead space right next to your seat, because everyone wasn‚Äôt trying to get into the first three overhead compartments, nor fight for the first eight rows of seats. 

It‚Äôs hard to lose the first love of your life, and that was the airline equivalent to me. I know the legacy airlines have problems (I gly them also quite regularly), but over the last few years, SWA became the Little Airline That Couldn‚Äôt. They raised their fares equal to or above the legacies, alienated their best customers by repeatedly diluting A-List and A-List Preferred perks, rolled over for the disability  abusers and seat (and whole row) savers, marketed to the greyhound bus traffic, and crushed their FA‚Äôs to the point where they spend most of the flight hiding in the galley or playing on their phones. 

It wasn‚Äôt all their fault. The fare advantage of rapid gate turnover and fuel hedging was copied and spread. The general loss of civility post-pandemic doomed the open seating plan (though actively facilitated by the airlines no-policy policies).

Can a new SWA be reborn? Maybe. We‚Äôll see. In the meantime I‚Äôll try to use them only when the options are poor and/or I want to burn up my miles bank.

   * 'New Account Bonus' section in credit card app says 'Spend $$$$by Dec 20, 2024 to earn 85,000 bonus rewards.""

A couple questions:

1. Did I for sure screw up the possibility of 2025/2026 CP with this signup date?
   * If yes, I assume my best course is to complete my spend ASAP to qualify for CP as soon as possible.  BUT - card fine print says 'possible 6-8 weeks' for delivery of bonus to my account.
2. What has been your experience in terms of wait time to receive the card bonus?
   * If I complete spend by end of next billing cycle (11/20) and the bonus takes 8 weeks to post to my account (so, in 2025), does that mean that the miles would then count for the 2025 calendar year, or would they somehow 'postdate' to this year because they were earned then?
   * Or, should I slow my roll on the spend and close out the full 3 months if points actually take 8 weeks to arrive and count toward the year that they appear?

Either way, I'm fine with it, CP still seems like a great bonus so 1 year/2 years, it's pretty cool either way.  Just wish I would have researched a bit more beforehand and done a better job making sure I maximized it.

Thanks in advance for any insights. 

TLDR;

Points/miles newbie, signed up for a SW credit card for bonus miles in September, curious if posting date of credit card bonus will for sure be in 2025 or possibility of 2024 if card bonus actually takes 8 weeks.

Certainly my first time ever having that happen! They were able to get the plane back under control within a second or two and we were all okay, but my goodness did the unsecured objects fly! (Kudos to the passengers, who all seemed to be belted in - nobody got hurt.)

I just want to point out two things that were night and day from my last ""emergency situation"", when coming back from my honeymoon on a Delta flight a few years ago, the crew suggested we were going to crash and then never communicated with the passengers again. Last night, the crew IMMEDIATELY got on the intercom to tell us that we were encountering some unexpected turbulence (no kidding!) and we would need to stay in our seats for the rest of the flight. Second of all, the captain was waiting as we got off and he and the FAs were apologising to us for the frightening experience. I got to talk to him for a minute or so and we actually chatted about the technicalities of what happened, which as an aviation enthusiast was super cool! It was a really wild experience that ended well, and I felt like the crew handled it spectacularly. If any of them see this (you probably know who you are! I doubt that happened to a lot of people last night), thank you from a happy passenger. &lt;3",KatiaSwift,4,41,SouthwestAirlines

1cksq78,2024-05-05 22:39:09,Seat Savers (rant),"Just had a first happen to me. I‚Äôm flying solo out of ATL on a completely full flight. I boarded in A group and got a window seat in front of the wings. I was on my phone with my AirPods on while everyone was boarding and not paying attention. As someone walked by, they threw an iPad and a neck pillow into the two seats beside me to save them. I wasn‚Äôt able to see who it was. The flight was getting increasingly full and people were giving me dirty looks and even saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt reserve seats‚Äù to me as they walked by. I was getting really stressed because I didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble for seat saving. I asked everyone around me if they saw who the items belonged to, and they said no. Finally a couple approached me and I told them the same thing, that I had no idea who the items belonged to. The couple put the items in the seat back pockets and sat next to me. Then, shortly after, the people in row across from me said ‚Äúwill you hand us our stuff?‚Äù They were the seat savers even after they saw and heard me asking whose stuff was in the seats. Seat saving is already ridiculous, but especially next to a complete stranger, on a full flight, in rows 5-10, without accepting accountability when asked. Just wanted to share/vent. Don‚Äôt be a seat saver. And if you‚Äôre the two men who put their items in this row without telling me then denied it: You‚Äôre jackasses. I guarantee you could‚Äôve sat next to your buddies in row 30 without issue instead of taking up prime seats in the front of the plane. 

Here‚Äôs an edit for additional context for the (few) people defending seat saving: this post isn‚Äôt bashing them for just seat saving. It‚Äôs bashing them for saving seats NEXT TO A STRANGER (me), while letting me take all the blame/dirty looks/snide comments and appearing innocent themselves. Save your seats, it‚Äôs annoying but whatever, but don‚Äôt save them next to someone you don‚Äôt even know and have them take the heat for it. ",notthevaledictorian,244,1339,SouthwestAirlines

1fptz9m,2024-09-26 19:33:55,"Urgent Complaint Against Delta Airlines and BPO Partner: Abusive Practices, Exploitation, and Unethical Management","
Dear People of the earth,

I am writing as an employee from Manila, Philippines to raise a formal complaint against Delta Airlines and its BPO partner in the Philippines. I am experiencing and witnessing multiple unethical practices that not only violate the rights of employees but also exploit local talent. I believe it is critical to bring these issues to light, not just for the sake of current employees, but also to inform the wider community, including stakeholders in the United States of America, about these troubling practices.

1. **Abusive Clients:** Many employees are subjected to verbal abuse and harassment from clients, which is often ignored by management. Despite reporting these instances, workers receive little to no support, leaving them to endure a toxic and unsafe working environment. This ongoing client abuse is unacceptable and must be addressed immediately.

2. **Promotions Without Legal Documentation:** Employees are often given promotions without any legal documentation or formal contracts, leading to confusion and exploitation. Many workers are forced to take on additional responsibilities without a corresponding increase in salary or official recognition of their new roles. This practice undermines legal employment standards and creates uncertainty for workers about their job security.

3. **Abusive Management:** In addition to the abuse from clients, many managers engage in intimidating, manipulative, and unfair practices. Employees have reported instances of bullying, FAVORITISM, and discriminatory behavior from management, creating a deeply toxic work environment. This abuse is damaging to the well-being and morale of employees and cannot be allowed to continue.

4. **Low Salaries:** Despite the skills and dedication demonstrated by employees, the compensation offered is far below industry standards. Many workers in the Philippines are underpaid and overworked, struggling to make ends meet. The wages offered by Delta Airlines‚Äô BPO partner are significantly lower than those given to their global counterparts, which further underscores the exploitation of local talent.

5. **Exploitation of Local Talent:** It is clear that Delta Airlines and its BPO partner are taking advantage of the local workforce in the Philippines by paying substandard wages and offering minimal benefits. Filipino workers, despite their high-quality work and dedication, are undervalued and exploited for cheap labor. This unjust practice not only disrespects local employees but also damages the company's global reputation.

I am calling on the relevant labor authorities and human rights organizations to urgently investigate these practices and take necessary action to stop the exploitation and abuse of Filipino workers. It is essential that Delta Airlines and its BPO partner be held accountable for these unethical practices and ensure fair treatment, proper compensation, and a safe work environment for all employees.

I hope this complaint will also raise awareness in the United States, where Delta Airlines is headquartered, as it is crucial for American stakeholders to understand the reality of how local talents in the Philippines are being treated under their operations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Hope this will reach your Heart ED BASTIAN.

1fqk1an,2024-09-27 17:50:23,Charging for Bags,"I started working for Southwest Airlines in 1993, all in Ground Operations/Ramp. I know this is or has been a very contentious issue here at SWA, both internally and externally. And to be upfront/honest, nobody with any precision can know the exact effect of charging for bags would have, since Southwest is the only carrier now for many years offering not 1 but 2 free bags on all fares/flights. But I want to give my view/perspective on this matter, and why I believe it would be beneficial in a lot of ways if we started to charge for bags.

1) Less Bags. I truly believe over the last 16 years when American Airlines was the first carrier to introduce bag fees, Southwest has not only stood by their no bag fee policy, but they actually continued to heavily promote this policy, running ad after ad that customers can check in two 50 lb bags. Not to fault the customer, but this causes customers to not really think about the amount of luggage they actually need, because they are constantly reinforced that two bags will fly free. This has undoubtedly lead to an enormous amount increase in the unnecessarily amount of checked bags we see. Hard to put a number but I believe around 25-30% less bags would be checked right off the bat. 

2) Less Sick &amp; On the Job Injuries. The workload increase on the amount of bags handled here has definitely had in increase in both of these departments, costing the company millions of dollars each year. 

3) Less Fuel Burn. More bags means heavier airplanes, which in turn takes more fuel to burn. Reducing the weight of the aircraft by 25-30% less luggage will save you millions of $$$ over the year, especially when running 4k daily departures.

4) Less Ramp Staffing. Back in 1993 and profit the first 10-15 years, the staffing at SWA was basically one ramp agent per daily departure at your station. That number climbed slowly to 2 to 1 over the next few years, but it has since exploded now to almost 4/5 to 1. Things are obviously different than back in the 90's, and I'm not advocating to go back to a 1/1 ratio, but there is definitely a higher amount of ramp workers needed now to deal with the large increase in passenger bags. 

5) Carryon Customer &amp; Airfares. Right now since 2 free bags are given to all SWA customers, that naturally makes us higher or not competitive when going head to head with any other carrier on the same route. Since they all have a la carte fares, they can advertise basic fares for less money. And we have many customers that only carryon, so that customer has no benefit whatsoever to bags fly free, and in fact it actually costs him money with a higher airfare. 

6) Turn Times. Less bags would allow us to turn the airplanes faster, which in turn would increase profits, as planes make money when they can fly more often, versus sitting on the ground for long stretches.

Finally I will leave everyone with this analogy/comparison. I've been traveling to LAS ever since I was 21, which was 1993. There was no resort fees back then, and I believe they started around 1997, to didn't really kick in until early 2000's. I was a Diamond member of Harrahs, who owned about 8 or so different properties at the time, and being that status I never had to pay for rooms or fees. But I do remember them initially being different and not charging. Well that didn't last long and they quickly started charging. Now in 2024 every single strip hotel is charging a resort fee, and if they didn't work or were failing, you would see them either being eliminated or reduced, but it's the exact opposite that has happened, they have steadily gone up. As for all US airlines in 2023, they brought in a staggering 7.1 billion in baggage fees, with American Airlines bringing in 1.4 billion alone. Again, whether something works or not will be seen if the fee sticks, or do they have to eliminate/reduce it because of less demand. The evidence is very clear that not only have baggage fees stuck, they are increasing year after year. Southwest continues to maintain it would be a net revenue negative to charge for bags, I believe the numbers say otherwise.",OutsidePerception646,26,0,SouthwestAirlines

I sat in the first row right side middle seat along with my husband at the window and you noticed when he was trying to get a response from me. He called out my name several times and tried to shake a response from me.  We had 15 minutes left before descent to land.  I sat eyes wide open unresponsive, unable to see, hear or feel touch.
When I was able to see again you were crouched in front of me. Speaking softly and rubbing my arm asking if I could see you. You brought me something to drink and helped clean me and my seat when I was unable to hold my cup.  Thank you so much for your kindness and care when you had a hundred other passengers on board.

While Dierks was getting drunk on a plane and Samuel fighting snakes on a plane, Unbeknownst to us, I was having a stroke on the plane.
I do not recall any of this, it is second hand information from my husband.  I heard you before I could see you or feel your touch.  I do remember the kindness and concern in your eyes when my sight returned and your reassuring touch on my arm.

It has taken a few days to send this message because the next day I  was admitted to hospital.  
I am grateful that I still have my faculties and able to see, hear and write this message. 
While I have choices and options to fly other airlines,  I choose Southwest. I repeatedly  choose Southwest.

For the passengers of flight 1326, especially those in the seats behind and to side of me, you also have my gratitude for your kindness to a complete  stranger.

First red flag is he has his bag under the middle seat and when I move it he goes ‚Äújust leave it there you can put your bag somewhere else‚Äù. Absolutely not so I move his bag to in front of him and put my backpack under. He scoffs but then proceeds to try to talk to me but I‚Äôm just trying to ignore and watch my show. This couple then proceeds to  tal over me, passing stuff across me, and I ask them  how about we swap seats cause I‚Äôm not doing this for 3 hours. And he goes no not happening I like the isle she likes the window. 
Once again I am just like whatever it‚Äôs the nature of the beast with SW. 

But then he keeps putting his arm on my rest and his leg is like full blown on my side, under the center seat and he is kicking my backpack. So I like nudge his leg and arm to try to get him to take a hint. I get you‚Äôre 90 but this isn‚Äôt ok. 

So as we‚Äôre taking off I put my air on. He loses his shit and he told me ‚Äúget that off me‚Äù. I told him it‚Äôs literally not on you. I‚Äôm in the middle so it‚Äôs possible the flow is hitting you but I offered you to swap. He goes off saying he is cold and I need to turn it off. Once again I tell him no. He then proceeds to reaches over me and plugs the AC with his finger! I‚Äôm instantly like you cannot do this you cannot  touch me. Please stop. But he doesn‚Äôt move. I‚Äôm getting ready to call FA  but we‚Äôre actively taxing. So I put my arm on rest and he fucking elbows the shit out of me and started yelling something along the lines of ‚Äúlisten here you disrespectful little girl‚Ä¶‚Äù 
At that point I tuned it out and for some reason it just triggered me. I begin shaking and crying and the flight attendant like walked over. As I said, we were taking off so she was like if you move right now we‚Äôre going to have to land and restart take off process. And there may be a ground stop cause of the weather. We can but it‚Äôs not ideal.  He asks him to just not touch me or talk to me for 5 min. And he starts hysterically laughing and was like she‚Äôs the one touching me blah blah blah.

I just put my airpods in and was like yes that‚Äôs fine but he needs to not touch me at all.  

Luckily some man swapped me seats but I felt bad cause he had first row and so much leg room and then got stuck with no leg room and the ass hole old man. 

After the flight numerous people came up to me asking if I was ok. I was grateful for their kindness but I also felt so embarrassed for crying in the moment. Two people said the man was disrespectful in the airport talking about the amount of ‚ÄúMexicans‚Äù there. 

All is fine now. Happy to be home, and not been recorded and posted on internet. Really never had any expierences like this on any flight.",maroonmallard,216,1152,SouthwestAirlines
1fg653v,2024-09-14 05:33:15,MDW-STL Today,"Wanted to get thoughts on my flight experience today -

I was flying from Midway to St Louis this afternoon. Boarding starts on time, there‚Äôs a small issue that they‚Äôre fixing resulting in the AC being off when we get on - no problem. Around our take off time, the captain announces that we cannot move from the gate as a military human remains plans is parked next to us and they‚Äôre about to begin their procession. To show respect, engines will remain off until the procession is complete. 

People. lose. it. Everyone around me was huffing and puffing and eventually they let people off. The procession ended relatively quickly and it must have taken longer to get people back on board in my opinion.

For me, I would think that showing respect to a fallen soldier or civilian would take precedence over throwing a hissy fit about the freaking AC. 
I was so disappointed in how the people on this flight reacted to what was a minor inconvenience imo. It was in the high 70s at best when this happened.

Side note: SW staff was LOVELY throughout the whole situation.",Numerous-Spirit3090,25,57,SouthwestAirlines

1dswwp7,2024-07-02 00:12:27,Crazy lady in exit row,"So i was flying home yesterday and for part of it i had a flight from Dallas to Savannah. I sat in one of the exit rows that had 2 seats and then a gap for the door. A few minutes later a woman sits next to me and then one of the flight attendants starts doing the whole thing of going through exit row information and asking if everyone is willing to help in case of an emergency, this is where things go south.

Everyone except her says yes, she ignores the flight attendant, she gets asked again and ignores. For a third time she gets asked and is like ""i don't care! my son is in the hospital let's just go"" and is full on yelling some other stuff at the flight attendant. Tried to get 2 others flight attendants to calm her down and offers to move her to a different seat since the flight wasn't full. She also said stuff along the lines about how there was a language barrier, she spoke perfectly fine English but with a small accent. Also how no other airline she has been on has open seating, which like she chose southwest so that's on her. She tried moving to the row ahead of me which was still an exit row and then more yelling.

This went on for like 5-10 minutes and eventually one of the flight attendants grabbed her bag out of the overhead bin and she was kicked off. I've never experienced anything like this on a flight before so i was just sort of in shock but also laughing at the situation.

She looked to the man in the seat behind her, presumably her husband, who was also trying to save that entire row for their family that was in the last boarding group. They made sounds of discontent, called me a bitch, tried to tell me the FAs told them they could do that, whined about how her ""nieces are just little girls!""....they were teenagers.

Honest to goodness, from the people who were pushing the chairs to the flight attendants to the passengers everyone was absolutely wonderful. The wheelchair attendants were friendly and quick. The FAs were helpful and kind. The other passengers were friendly without being overly chatty. It was great!

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone here who calmed my nerves and gave me good advice.

Each year I come out ahead on points, so that's not an issue.

The thing is, I constantly check the ShothwestHotels website for changes in points for the hotels where I want to stay. And occasionally, when I do the same search, it shows no reward points for the same hotel. And I'm not talking day to day. I am talking different browsers at the same time, or different tabs in the same browser simultaneously. One will show RR points while the other won't. And I can't figure out any consistency to it. So, I wonder if I could make some change to consistently show the right number of points. Or, if possible, show even more RR points, instead of less.

Just as our number group was about to be called, a flight attendant came up to me and said, ""do you already have an extra seat?"" Now, I'm no skinny thang, but I easily fit in the seats and fly pretty often -- mostly the middle seat, and I never touch any other passengers even in middle. 

I was like, huh? She took my ticket out of my hand (??) and then said, ""come with me."" I said, ""I think you may have the wrong person,"" to which she snapped back at me saying she has the exact right person. I was confused and tbh a little scared, so was my husband, who was standing behind me. 

I didn't follow her at first, and literally everyone was staring at me and they stopped calling groups for a moment. She said loudly, ""you're travelling alone, right?"" Although I said no, she didn't even hear me because she was already walking. This time, when she said to follow her again, I followed. My husband followed me. 

We got right up to hallway thing to board the plane/scan the ticket, and the FA said ""it's a full flight so we just wanted to give you an extra seat to make sure you're comfortable."" My husband and I both were just staring in total confusion and shock ü§£ 

So we got on the plane, and we sat down with me by the window and my husband in the middle. Another FA made an announcement over the plane for [my name] to please wave my hands so they can find me. I waved, they came and handed me a seat reserver ticket and walked away. Someone sat down in the aisle seat in our row. That was that. 

I was not the fattest person on that plane by far, I could very clearly fit into those seats with no problem (if they had handed me a seatbelt extender preemptively I would have just about died, lol), and there were plenty of mothers with babies or toddlers that could have used that extra seat, but didn't get it. 

What is this? Do I even make a complaint? I fly Southwest all the time, including other airlines, and have never had a problem. ",doctorelisheva98,218,344,SouthwestAirlines

179r1le,2023-10-17 13:29:25,Incident with another passenger,"Tonight my husband and I were on a Southwest flight home from our tenth anniversary trip when, upon landing, we were accused by another passenger of taking her picture while she was sleeping (of course we hadn‚Äôt; pretty sure she was drunk.) She was standing in the aisle, hovering over me as I sat in my seat, yelling in my face, dropping f-bombs, insulting me, my husband, and the FAs. It continued for the entirety of our wait to deplane (we were in the very last row, so it took quite a while.) Her friend chimed in quite a bit as well. I tried to stay as calm as I could with someone yelling in my face, but it was really tough. I asked for security to be called, then my husband and I waited until she and her friend finally left down the aisle before we got up ourselves.

Police were waiting when we deplaned and got statements from both parties, but told us that since the incident didn‚Äôt include any physical assault, there was nothing they could do. A Southwest representative also got a statement, but then quickly disappeared to talk to the FAs. We didn‚Äôt see him again. 

My question is: do I have any recourse here? My husband and I were minding our own business listening to podcasts for the majority of the flight and have no idea how all this happened. I don‚Äôt feel like anyone really showed us any compassion after the fact, and we were made to wait until after the women were gone before we could leave the airport. I‚Äôm still super upset by the incident and it definitely left a dark cloud over an otherwise wonderful trip.

I was stuck all the way back at A-19, but somehow got my preferred bulkhead aisle seat!  I had to put my backpack and overnight bag in the bin on the other side of the plane. Across the aisle was a POS who needed a seatbelt extender. The flight attendant told us there were 40 empty seats on this plane and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, I had an empty seat next to me. 
The guy in the window seat had the audacity to ask me if I wanted the shade up or down.  I chose up, but he said it didn‚Äôt matter to him. 
The flight attendants did their beverage service and even had time to do a follow-up with coffee and water. Plus, they handed out both Brownie Brittle and Maui Pretzels. Then they decided to charge me for my cocktail. I had to dig out my phone to show the FA my free drink coupon.

zvvpfd,2022-12-27 04:13:02,Some thoughts,"I‚Äôve been watching the posts on here. I‚Äôm an airline pilot for another company but I fly Southwest frequently. The factors of this system failure are complex, and will take months to fully sort out. Weather was the initial trigger, but this is beyond that now. Crews and aircraft are out of place in a network structured differently than other airlines, plus reportedly aging IT systems, inability to reassign crew efficiently (my southwest pilot friend was stuck for two days on a trip unable to reach anyone), and overwhelming volume of rebookings and changes that are snowballing. But what can you do right now?

If your flight is in the next few days, I would assume it will be delayed or canceled. 

If possible, drive your own car, rent a car or rebook on another airline. 

Consider flying into an airport within 5 hours of your destination, and renting a car from that point. If you‚Äôre currently stranded in a city, consider driving to another.  

As far as refunds outside of a flight credit, fill out the customer service contact form, and leave it alone for a week. I doubt you‚Äôll get through to anyone right now. You can always dispute on your credit card later. 

Lastly, get some food and keep drinking water. It‚Äôs easy to lose track of your personal health on days like these. And avoid ranting with other passengers. It can seem helpful at first, but I find too much and you just make yourself more stressed.

Just an accident, the women felt really bad, not an expensive bag, but a newer Swiss Gear bag, about $175.  In this situation would Southwest reimburse me for a new bag?  Would it just be more appropriate for me to submit the damage with pictures and omit the how it was damaged?  I want to be transparent, but I didn't damage my bag.

Thanks in advance.

Edit:  More than anything, I was just curious on liability scenarios in situations like these and thought it might present an interesting debate to my real-life situation.  The bag is less than a year old and bought with an AmEx card, so I will take a look at buyer protection and possible warranty, thanks for the suggestions.

Edit:  Request was for an update.  Southwest denied the claim.  The denial was an obvious form email where no one even read the scenario or situation.  As a matter of fact, they said the tear appeared to be normal wear and tear and just said we know you may be disappointed, and we hope you continue to fly with Southwest in the future.

However, our flight was changed without notice. I just happened to look on the site and noticed that they added in a layover. So our travel time went from just over 2 hours, to now over 4 hours. I had to scramble and rebook a different flight to ensure we still got a Non-stop. It is so early in the morning now, and I have to get the kids up super early for this flight.

1cw7tyu,2024-05-20 13:15:16,Guy lied about his number before boarding and got called out,"I recently flew from Santa Barbara home to Chicago (with a stopover in Las Vegas). I saw the ticket of a guy near me well before getting in line (he was B11). I waited a bit to get in line but had an idea of where to go as I heard a lady say she was B6 and I was 7. When I went to walk over he was in my way, the whole area was really congested so there was nowhere to just stand without getting in front of someone or going pretty far back into the line (probably because it's a teeny tiny airport). Instead of just walking in front of him I asked him his number (even though I knew, it just seemed easier than saying ""I know I'm in front of you"" ) and he said he was 3. I couldn't believe it! I can't imagine lying to someone's face to board 20 seconds sooner. 

I went up to the folks at the counter when there was a break between folks boarding and said something along the lines of: I can't tell you what to do and it's really not a huge deal but this guy just flat out lied about his number and the audacity of it kind of pissed me off. If you don't want to approach it that's fine but if you did that would be pretty great. He's B11 claiming to be 3. We start boarding and he's a few people ahead of me and the woman at the counter loudly says ""Woah woah woah! You're too early. You have to step aside and wait your turn"". He thought she was kidding but she was like ""I'm serious, go wait"". It was fantastic! He just had to stand there like an asshole. Of course he shouted for his wife to save him a seat.

I've flown SW for years and took the opportunity to say hello and to thank him for continuing service at my small regional airport. He was kind and gracious to me and anyone else who was talking to him.

While I know C-suite people can get a bad reputation (and SW meltdowns under his leadership are absolutely valid) it was refreshing to see him helping out the cabin crew (taking people's trash without gloves!) and at least making an effort.

Thank you all.

Post Edit:

We will be staying in Fullerton and visiting the tourist attractions, Hollywood, Universal/Disney, etc.

Second Edit:

Thank You all for your advice and recommendations.

Another reason my mother doesn‚Äôt want to fly into LAX is that about 12 years ago we flew in at night and as we were waiting for the rental shuttle some guy decided that the traffic at LAX was too much and drove on the sidewalk. My mom had to pull me out of the way, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be here today. All I remember was people running and jumping out of the way so the car wouldn‚Äôt hit them.

1fytaop,2024-10-08 14:21:04,Good Experience Honolulu to/from Las Vegas - Mini Trip Report,"Had a very good experience on Southwest (WN) going from Honolulu (HNL) to/from Las Vegas (LAS) with my wife to watch a college football game this past weekend.  We were originally scheduled to fly from HNL to Sacramento on Thursday and then on to LAS.  When we arrived at HNL, after driving through a nightmarish traffic jam from the west side of Oahu, we went to the gate to see if we could get on an earlier non-stop flight (had only carry-on luggage).  We had waited until midnight local time to see if we could get on the same day standby list and, unfortunately,  the Southwest app indicated ""See Agent"".  At the gate, where boarding was about to start, a very nice agent indicated that they had two seats available on the direct HNL to LAS - when I had checked on the app at midnight, it showed that there were, indeed, two seats available.  We were given paper boarding passes by the nice agent, and, oddly, my wife got a B boarding group and I got the dreaded C boarding group - this worked out, however, as my wife was able to secure an aisle seat in one of the last rows of the aircraft, and I was able to sit next to her after I boarded in group C even though the flight was completely full.  I have noted that on all of the WN Hawaii flights that I have taken, most of the passengers are traveling in groups of two or more, which makes sense as it is primarily a leisure destination.  There was plenty of room in the overhead bins, even though we were not in the A boarding group and we were able to store our carry-ons easily.  The aircraft was a MAX 8 and had the USB A and C charging ports on the seat back in front of us, and the seats were comfortable, with decent legroom.  The free smartphone WiFi live TV/movies/messaging for iMessages and WhatsApp worked well (no pictures could be sent, though), and, interestingly, I received occasional Reddit Alerts during the flight (I could not, however, connect to Reddit to read the threads).  I watched the latest ""Bad Boys"" movie, and slept the rest of the voyage.  During the flight, we were given one box that contained Wheat Thins, cheese spread, gummies, and a snack mix.  Additionally, flight attendants came through the cabin four times to offer drinks/water - they did not, however, give  passengers full cans of soda.  The seats were not too uncomfortable and time seemed to pass quickly.  The flight left the gate at HNL one minute early and arrived at the gate in LAS 29 minutes early.  Flight attendants were mostly friendly, with the exception of one very unpleasant and dour looking female attendant.  At times, there were queues to get into the lavatories - I waited a good five minutes to go to one of the rear lavatories.  All-in-all, we were delighted that we were able to fly on the direct HNL - LAS flight and that WN offered us the ability to switch flights with their same day standby policy.

On a negative note, the Southwest arrivals/departure gates (Terminal 1, B/C gates) at the Las Vegas Airport are atrocious - look and feel worse than a bus station.  The gates and adjoining areas are small, seem to lack ventilation, have bad lighting, are dirty, and the bathrooms were disgusting.  This is in comparison to the gates in the Las Vegas Airport Terminal 3, which we went to on our day of departure to accompany family members who were leaving on an F9 flight to Dallas, that was modern, clean and well maintained.

Our return to HNL Sunday also went well.  We were not able to get on the direct flight from LAS to HNL as there were no same day standby seats available.  Our itinerary was originally from LAS to Kona (KOA), with a 3.5 hour layover until our flight to HNL.  We checked-in exactly 24 hours ahead of our scheduled first flight, and, oddly, I was assigned boarding group B and my wife group C.  We were not able to sit together as I ended up with an isle seat in the back of the aircraft, and my wife, even though she was in group C, snagged a window seat in the front of the plane - not sure how that happened!   This flight provided the same level of service, including identical snack/beverage service as our previous flight, and it was completely full.  The flight attendants were all friendly and pleasant, but were insistent on passengers correctly filling out the Hawaii Department of Agriculture entry forms - they actually reviewed each form when passengers handed them back.  I must say that this is in contrast to other airlines that we have flown to Hawaii, where the flight attendants do not look at the forms and many locals do not bother filling them out.  There were, however, no USB A and C outlets on the seat backs of this MAX 8, and the free WiFi/movies/TV/messaging went out towards the end of the Buffalo Bills game that I was watching for half an hour.  Our flight departed LAS five minutes early and arrived in KOA four minutes early.  Seats were comfortable and had a slight recline capability.  Here is the AMAZING thing:  As soon as we got off our flight (at KOA, disembarking is quick as there are air stairs in both the front and back of the aircraft), we went to a hut, (yes, a hut) where a very pleasant WN customer agent was able to get us on a flight that had already started boarding for HNL, resulting in us getting to HNL, our home airport, over 3 hours early.  I would note that, again, the Southwest app did not allow us to add ourselves to the same day standby list for the earlier KOA-HNL flight - this makes sense, though, as it was likely not a ""legal"" connection.  In any case, this was amazing as our LAS-KOA flight arrived at the gate in KOA at 1316 and our departing flight to HNL left the gate at 1346 - so, it took exactly half an hour to make our connection, including disembarking, talking with the Southwest CSR to change our flight, and boarding the new flight, which was half empty.

In summary, we loved the flexibility that Southwest provides with the same day standby, and appreciated the excellent CSRs that they had at both HNL and KOA airports.  Seats were comfortable and the free smartphone Wifi/movies/live TV/messaging were nice.  Food and snack service was also good.  We usually fly on other airlines from HNL, but this experience will have us putting Southwest on top of our list for future travel.",pmagloir,4,8,SouthwestAirlines
1g5ckrh,2024-10-17 06:58:49,Another example of an antiquated system or a company unwilling to perform as promised?,"I unfortunately had to evacuate due to hurricane Milton. I had changed my flight time twice due to the fear of the airport possibly closing.   The airport then announces that they were closing the day that I was scheduled to fly out, so I booked my new flight as quickly as I could on the app, with my SW card, as there were only three seats left. Because I already had a flight booked with a credit, I called into customer service to have everything changed around. I was told that they couldn‚Äôt book my new flight with the credit because it was the same day and they didn‚Äôt have info the airport was closing, but to call back afterwards to get everything corrected.

 After rushing to pack, dealing with an in-law, as well as drugging up a dog and a cat to get them in carriers (which they have never done) the stress level was at a nine. Get the flight out, land, deal with the ATL airport busyness, hour at the rental car place, and finally into the hotel room. I called back and was told I had to write in because it wasn‚Äôt something they could do on the phone. Fine, I do so, taking almost an hour to document all the prior flight times, amounts, numbers, etc. 

I just received a phone call and was told that I am out of luck and I will ultimately be charged over $400 on my credit card for a one-way, 1.5 hour flight and they are not able to use my prior credit or points, even though the agent on the phone told me they absolutely would do so. The most disrespectful statement was that I agreed to terms and conditions when I bought the tickets so I should‚Äôve known that it wouldn‚Äôt be corrected. 

What that means is that you are no longer able to go by the word of an employee at a company, but instead need to read the small print or you will be screwed.
I was offered $100 voucher, but this is the third issue with incorrect information. No longer is Southwest a customer service oriented value company, as the flights aren‚Äôt much cheaper than most others.

But now, there are all sorts of shenanigans going on.

People are saving the aisle seat like they have a captains reservation there.  

The super dirty‚Ä¶. ‚Äúsaving two seats‚Äù but only one person they know shows up.  I‚Äôve only seen this a few times.  It‚Äôs really hard to tell it‚Äôs happening unless you sit close and keep an eye on them.

And‚Ä¶. the secret save.  A husband and wife in the isle and window, pile their shit into the middle seat and pretend not to know each other while reading their iPads.  If someone wants the middle, they offer the window up and the wife moves to to middle (usually).

So many that right before our son reached us in row 12, they announced there were only a couple empty rows left in the back of the plane, and that people should take the first empty seats they saw.

In contrast our DEN to SJC leg, the gate agents followed the correct pre boarding rules and procedures and there were plenty of empty rows left for the 3 of us with B26-B28.

-------

Any advice on my situation would be appreciated.

I am new to SW and I'm trying to achieve CP status. I booked a hotel (Spark by Hilton)  through the SW app for $400 and 10k points. I received an email confirmation with the booking details (hotel name, address etc). When I went to check in, the hotel advised no reservation was in their system and that it's probably in the hotel (Best Western) across the street. I was confused about this as my confirmation stated Hilton. The hotel attendant said that these properties are managed by the same company and so this was a common occurrence. When I checked into the BW the rate was only $80/night. I tried calling the concierge # on the email confirmation and they were no help, even when escalated to a supervisor. They pretty much said nothing could be done. What was supposed to be a relaxing weekend turned into a stressful one. All I wanted was for the reservation to be honored at the hotel I booked. Since it wasn't I want to be reimbursed the difference in cost and possibly keep my points as compensation for the problems we faced. Is that too much to ask? Does anyone know the contact info for anyone in leadership at SW?

1g7iq70,2024-10-20 05:07:03,Questions - Standby w/ checked bags,"I am late to the game and **just** discovered the same day standby option on SW.  I traveled this past weekend and was able to take advantage of the policy to catch an earlier, direct flight.  ***LOVED IT!***  I wasn't sure exactly how it worked, so I purposely waited until my shuttle was 5 minutes from the airport (and confident I could make the standby flight) before putting myself on the list.  Once inside the airport, I went to the kiosk to check in.  It still showed my original flight &amp; boarding position, but when my baggage tags printed, they were already adjusted to the standby flight.  Questions:  
  
1.  Did the tags print like this because the standby flight showed 85 seats available, so the system ""assumed"" (due to some algorithm) that I would easily make that flight **\*OR\*** is that standard procedure to ensure that even if YOU don't make the flight, your bags will be waiting at your destination when you arrive?  
  
2.  If the latter scenario occurs (bags get on standby flight, but you don't), do the baggage handlers at destination airport get alerted somehow to place luggage directly with the baggage service desk?  I feel a bit uneasy about my unclaimed bags going around &amp; around the carousel, appearing abandoned and ripe for the taking!

1fcuch7,2024-09-10 00:56:33,Missing gift card balance?,"We paid for a recent trip with a gift card and had about $100 remaining balance. At the time of payment, we assumed that we were adding the gift card balance to our account, and applying it as payment for that trip. However, we logged in today to book another flight and we're surprised to see our available credit balance as $0.

According to the employee on the phone, we were expected to keep the physical gift card as we would need to enter it as payment method for each individual trip. There is no possibility to add a gift card balance to your account, such as you do for Amazon, etc.

Does this make sense? We threw away the gift card because at the time of the original booking, it seemed like we were adding the complete gift card balance to our account. Is there no way to recover and use that remaining balance?",mashedtaters_,14,0,SouthwestAirlines

1cultp6,2024-05-18 09:27:53,My quilt coat was mistaken for a blanket,"To be fair, I get it. It‚Äôs literally quilted like a‚Ä¶quilt. It was slung over my arm like usual. But when the Gate Agent told me to consolidate it before she‚Äôd scan my boarding pass, and I told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just put it on‚Äù, that should have been a clue that it was WEARABLE, and therefore not a blanket! She insisted that I consolidate it, and I said one more time ‚Äúit‚Äôs a COAT!‚Äù And she wouldn‚Äôt back down. So in the interest of boarding and not taking the chance that my father would be on this plane and I would not, I shoved it into my carryon. Once on the jet bridge, I stopped at the back of the line and took my COAT out of the suitcase. The Gate Agent could not have seen me, because of the turn in the bridge. But she came down the bridge to find me (probably suspecting I would take it out of my suitcase), and yelled ‚ÄúI told you, you needed to consolidate that!‚Äù At this point I was able to hold it up and point to the pockets and zipper and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting it ON because I‚Äôm COLD!!‚Äù I was not, in fact, cold, as this was Houston, but I couldn‚Äôt let her win at this point.

1dtubmn,2024-07-03 03:24:16,Idle Thoughts Hot Take: give priority boarding to customers that don't have a carry-on. ,"If we could get 25% of the passengers to check a bag and just board with a backpack / bag / purse we would all board and deplane so much easier. Would knowing you will be a ""High B"" because you checked a bag be incentive enough to change your behavior? I'm not suggesting that a bag-checker would jump ahead of existing status holders or folks that pay for upgrades. Just ahead of general steerage folks that carryon. 

I love checking a bag w/ SWA and have never once had a problem with a lost /delayed bag (I just jinxed myself). When I fly another airline and do carryon (because I'm a cheapskate) I don't really notice getting on or off airport property significantly faster. Yes, it's easier / faster but it doesn't seem tremendously so. At some inefficient airports (I'm looking at you, DEN) it's almost for sure a wash. 

If that shift was to happen, would Southwest regret it due to the demands of having to handle that much more baggage? 

I could see flight attendants all excited that we are boarding faster but baggage handlers seething and cranky due to increased workload. Who would win if it was a battle? Flight attendants can be pretty scrappy in a pinch. Don't rule them out. ",sonofawhatthe,194,606,SouthwestAirlines

zw6upo,2022-12-27 12:43:28,"Hey guys, SWA pilot with a little information","We‚Äôre really trying to get you guys home. I‚Äôm so sorry so many of you got this screwed over on your Christmas vacations. This is entirely managements fault. Gary Kelly, and the new CEO, and corporate barons have completely gutted the philosophy Herb believed in, which was investing in employees. They‚Äôve known for months that many crews were stretched to the absolute limit. It was only a matter of time before something caused a cascading series of failures that spiraled out of control. The board and CEO knew this, and chose to instead give themselves multi-million dollar bonuses and threaten to fire staff, along with dragging out contract negotiations with the unions in the hopes there will be a recession. This is corporate mismanagement to a level I‚Äôve never seen in this industry during my 25 years. 

Again, I‚Äôm so sorry for your travel cancellations and the complete lack of communication from anyone who should be updating you guys and leading the charge to fix this.

EDIT: user u/4sammich in a thread I was monitoring in r/flying has a pretty good update about what is going on. 

‚ÄúI have friends in CS and the hotel assignment side too. There were 2 specific problems, the software for scheduling is woefully antiquated by at least 20 years. No app/internet options, all manual entry and it has settings that you DO NOT CHANGE for fear of crashing it. Those settings create the automated flow as a crewmember is moving about their day, it doesn‚Äôt know you flew the leg DAL-MCO it just assumes it and moves your piece forward.
In the event of a disruption you call scheduling and they manually adjust you. It does work, it just works for an airline 1/3 the size of SWA.
So the storm came and it impacted ground ops so bad that many many crews were now ‚Äúunaccounted‚Äù for and the system in place couldn‚Äôt keep up. Then it happened for several more days. By Xmas evening the CS department had essentially reached the inability to do anything but simple, one off assignments. And to make matters worse, the phone system was updated not too long ago and it was not working well.
Last nite they did a web form and had planned to get the system up as much as possible with what communication they could muster, however it was too much to keep up on and ultimately the method for tracking crews failed again.
This 100% is at the feet of all management who refused to invest in technology updates because it is the southwest way to be stuck in 1993.‚Äù

Myself and my wife were traveling from NY to Ft Lauderdale. It was an early Sunday morning flight and we were A 17 and 18. Only 3 wheelchairs of folks who obviously needed them. Flight less than half full. Then the super Southwest win, no one had upgraded to A 1-15 so basically we boarded first. Flight crew was very chill and the entire boarding was relaxed. We boarded and row 2 was empty so I took the window my wife the asile so middle seat was open. Row 2 across from us were a mom, dad and about a 10 year old girl playing on the phone. Most of the rows towards the front and emergency row were taken again all middle seats were open. Then right before the cabin door closed a woman in her 60‚Äôs well dressed burst thru the door. Looked ok to me so I payed her no mind. Then she tells my wife she has to move to another seat as she was a pre board that ran late and was entitled yes she said entitled to sit in Row 2. Have no idea what was wrong with Row 1. Well as she should  the wife refused to move and went back to her I Pad. Well this didn‚Äôt go over well, she basically threw a fit demanding our seat. Again we declined. She got FA involved demanding he move my wife so she could have Row 2. FA was a pro and explained it wasn‚Äôt going to go that way. Now this shrew had a large DD coffee in one hand and a carry on in the other. When she didn‚Äôt get her way she said she would just take the middle seat between us or we could move to the back. Her bluff was called and off to the back she stomped. Grumbled to FA and other passengers about selfish people. After we landed we went to get our luggage and saw her giving us death glares while we waited. Then with no effort at all grabbed her bag and strutted off. Couldn‚Äôt tell what possible disability she had.
 Funny thing is if she was nice or really needed to sit there we would have gladly moved. But as soon as the word entitled was used we were glued into those seats.

1bstp89,2024-04-01 11:41:27,Scary unaccompanied minor situation,"My 10 year old son flew UM today. Short flight, just over an hour. I obviously was not there, but what I gathered from my son, flight crew, and a kind fellow passenger is that my son was sat in a window seat with a woman (the kind fellow passenger) in the aisle seat. A very large, seemingly unwashed man boarded after and attempted to sit next to my son, in the middle seat. The woman sitting in the aisle seat said no and moved over to the middle seat between my child and this man, but that didn‚Äôt stop the man from starting up a conversation with my son, asking him questions and he gave my child a phone number, saying it was the phone number of his own child. The woman alerted the flight crew, who called for the police to meet the plane at the gate. 

I was waiting at the gate for him, and when I saw the police officers showing up at the gate of the plane that my child was on, I panicked and asked the agents at the desk if everything was alright. She got her manager for me and he told me that there had been an incident with my son and another passenger, and that the police would be bringing the other passenger off of the plane and would probably want to speak to me. I was pretty much completely panicked, my son came off the flight first and then the man was brought off by the police, the situation was explained to me by the flight attendant, I spoke with and thanked the awesome woman who was looking out for my son and the flight crew for taking the situation so seriously, and we got out of the airport. 

I‚Äôm waiting for the police report to be finished so I can get that and figure out exactly who this man is and see if there are any details that I missed (I was panicked). I‚Äôm really sad and angry that this happened, and completely confused as to what the actual fuck is wrong with the man. The flight attendant thought that he noticed my kids unaccompanied minor lanyard and thought he would be an easy target. 

I am angry, but none of my anger is for Southwest‚Äôs staff, they did great taking the situation seriously and having protocols in place. They had moved my son after the woman alerted them, telling him it was so they could take him off the plane first. He didn‚Äôt even know there was a situation until he was coming off the plane and saw the police. 

Sorry for my rambling post, I‚Äôm shaken that this happened. And yes, we‚Äôre having many conversations about not talking to strangers. ",milliemaywho,133,698,SouthwestAirlines
17e44b3,2023-10-23 05:40:53,"""I know the rules."" - Gate Agent","This morning while leaving Cleveland, my wife was wearing her purse, her backpack and carrying her CPAP. I was wearing my backpack. I notice a mother wearing a carseat on her back, a backpack on her chest and a checked bag for a carseat/stroller that was going to be gatechecked. I offered to carry that down to the gate for her. When my wife scanned her ticked, the gate agent told my wife she had too many carry on items. She told her that her CPAP didn't count. I told her it was medical equipment and it was clearly marked with a HUGE red label I had purchased for it. The lady said ""I know the rules."" Instead of making a scene, my wife handed me her CPAP and the gate then objected because I had the lady's checked bad with baby's supplies in my hand. The lady who's stuff I had then stuck up for us and then told the lady we had her gate checked supplies. 

Look, I get it people have bad days but when she told my wife ""I know the rules."" I almost lost my cool. She clearly didn't.

1fuob2k,2024-10-03 03:08:25,Little Trick To Reduce Chance of Losing or Forgetting Gift Card Balance,"Southwest is the worst when it comes to how it handles gift cards.  Instead of storing the unused balance, you have to enter the gift card number and pin each time to use any unused balance.  Obviously this is by design as some people may forget they have a balance or lose their gift card number and pin later. 

You can store your gift card as a credit so you never lose it by simply booking a flight or combination of flights that use up the balance.  It may take a little time to find a flight cost that matches and maybe you'll have to pay a few dollars ($1-$5) out of pocket to use the entire gift card.  But then just go immediately cancel your flights and the refund goes back to your account as a credit.  The credit does not expire. Now you can toss the gift card and not worry about saving the number and pin for future use.

And yes, the credit is immediately available to use when you cancel the flights. So even if you had a $500 gift card and only needed to book a $200 flight. You could book an additional $300 in another flight or flights and just cancel them to store your gift card credit.

You can even transfer the flight credit to someone else if you want to so you aren't losing the transferability of the gift card value.

1g09lkh,2024-10-10 11:12:58,Bicycle policy makes no sense ,"TLDR: Southwests bike policy is practically impossible to abide by unless it‚Äôs a child sized bike you are trying to travel with. 

Long version: I‚Äôm traveling to compete in a triathlon for the first time and I want to bring my bike with me. I‚Äôve never checked a bike in a box before but was assured by some friends, the guys at the local bike shop, and YouTube that it is not a big deal. I go to the local shop and get a cardboard bike box, break my bike down and fit it into the box snuggly. I was warned not to pack too much extra stuff in the box to make sure I didn‚Äôt go over the weight limit so I only added a bit of padding and my bike shoes into the box with the bike. I get to the airport and lug the box to the counter and they tell me I would have to pay an extra $75 for oversized luggage. I remind them per their own policy that as long as the bike is in a box and under 50lbs it should be counted as one of my two free checked bags. The gate agent had to look up the policy and then acted confused that that was the case and called a manager over. The manager confirmed that yea that is the policy but only if the box is less than 80in. I hadn‚Äôt even considered the box might be too long because my bike literally could not be in a box that is any shorter. They measured it and it was 92in so they told me that it doesn‚Äôt meet the qualifications. At the point I just want to get on the flight so I‚Äôm like sure I‚Äôll pay the $75 extra dollars and they inform me that they can‚Äôt even accept a box that large. Meanwhile people next to me are bringing surfboard bags that are like 9ft long. The manager opens the box up to look inside (they were both really nice and wanting to help me even though they were clueless about their own policies and had to keep looking them up). The manager was shocked that the bike was flush with each end of the box, like I said it literally could not have been shorter even if I wanted it to be. They inform me that there isn‚Äôt anything they can do and I would have to have it designated as freight and shipped if I wanted to get it to San Diego. They offer to rebook me on a new southwest flight for tomorrow since this has all taken so long I‚Äôm in danger of missing my flight, but that doesn‚Äôt help me with the bike problem. Again they were so nice and seemed like they felt bad about the policy too since it made no sense. The only way for a bike to fit that policy is for it to be like a children‚Äôs bike or something. It doubly doesn‚Äôt make sense because they accept all kinds of other sports equipment and instruments that are larger. Like I said the person next to me was checking a 9ft surfboard bag that probably had multiple boards inside and was probably heavier than my bike box too. My bike only weighed 37lb. I ended up taking the refund and booking a flight on Alaskan airlines after wheeling my bike over to their counter and asking those gate agents if they would accept my bike box as a checked bag. They looked at me like I was crazy and said ‚Äúof course we see boxes like this all the time‚Äù. I looked on their website and it said boxes could be up to 112in for Alaskan airlines which could easily fit my bike. Idk why southwests policy is such a short length but it effectively is a bike box ban. ",Dangerous-Housing811,32,0,SouthwestAirlines

We do not live in Baltimore where we were stranded.

https://crankyflier.com/2024/06/13/elliott-doesnt-know-how-to-fix-southwest-nor-does-it-likely-care

The airline is cooked.  Thanks to some boneheaded management decisions and a market not interested in airline stocks it seems Southwest has assets that exceed its market cap.  

All Elliot has to do now is put on a show of ""fixing"" Southwest while slowly working it toward bankruptcy and creatively extracting value towards preferred creditors and shareholders.  

Eddie Lampart pulled this same stunt a few years ago with Sears when its underlying real estate was worth far more than the brand itself.

Does anyone know if Southwest has the capability to hang up garment bags or am I thinking of the old US Air flights?

UPDATE: As I suspected and as noted in several replies, SWA planes have no hang up space for garment bags. Our LAS-BWI flight went well with placing the wedding dress and my suit in the overhead (boarded 20ish, had plenty open). The FA made sure nobody moved them or crush them with their bags.

But that wasn't even the most interesting thing! I was A-31 so I watched this happen up close. During A1-A30 boarding, three separate passengers tried to board using paper boarding passes. All three hid the majority of the pass either in a book, or their phone case, so only the barcode was showing. The GA made them take it out and all three had C boarding passes!

The GA wasn't having it. He told each of them (loudly!) 'you're group C, you need to get out of line and wait!'. It was pretty funny watching them slink away. 

So, it's this a thing? Some TikTok travel hack? I thought it was pretty bold to try to sneak in so early. I wonder if they would have pulled it off if they had tried late A group or early B. ",QuiltyChrissy,274,1221,SouthwestAirlines

1g19f9q,2024-10-11 21:10:27,Detailed Article re: Assigned Seats Update,"Probably the most informative article Ive ready (with pictures) of the proposed seating diagram.

¬†

[https://crankyflier.com/2024/10/01/a-detailed-look-at-southwests-assigned-and-extra-legroom-seating-plan/](https://crankyflier.com/2024/10/01/a-detailed-look-at-southwests-assigned-and-extra-legroom-seating-plan/)

¬†

A few points of interest for me:

Retrofitting the 700s:

‚ÄúThe old ladies of the fleet are going to remain the worst experience unless you‚Äôre a tall person. This aircraft will lose a row, dropping from 143 to 137 seats. It will then have 40 extra legroom seats with a whopping 36‚Ä≥ of pitch. Everything else will be at 31‚Ä≥.

The worst part of this plan is that the -700s will not get new seats. They will keep the same seats and just have them recovered in the new design. They will not get power.

If this feels like lipstick on a pig, it is. These airplanes will be gone by the end of the decade, so apparently Southwest thinks it‚Äôs ok to just let them limp along. If you‚Äôre tall, the extra legroom section is great. If you‚Äôre not, avoid this airplane.‚Äù

¬†

800s/Max:

‚ÄúThese aircraft make up the bulk of Southwest‚Äôs fleet and will continue to have 175 seats onboard. Instead of having 32‚Ä≥ of seat pitch across the board, there will be 68 seats in the extra legroom sections with 34‚Ä≥ of pitch. The rest will drop to 31‚Ä≥ of pitch.

As of now, there are more than 120 aircraft that have Southwest‚Äôs newish Meridian seat that has power installed. Those will keep those seats but be recovered in the new design and moved around to create the extra legroom section. Once everything is approved by the FAA, new deliveries will get the new Recaro seats. There are apparently about 60 of these airplanes that still have the old seats. I believe these will be replaced with the new Recaro seats when the time comes, but some of those may end up being sold off anyway, so we‚Äôll see.‚Äù

¬†

I have not seen a map of the proposed seating plan (I am sure someone else has posted it but still interesting ‚Äì the map is in the article)

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The cabin is broken into four different areas.

o¬†¬† The first five rows on each side make up 30 extra legroom seats. There is only a row 1 on the starboard side of the aircraft, so that means in row 6, the port side has extra legroom while the starboard side does not.¬†

o¬†¬† That next chunk of seats in front of the exit includes 45 regular seats which will fall into the ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù cabin, meaning you‚Äôll pay extra to reserve these seats in advance.

o¬†¬† How the exit rows fall is somewhat unclear to me. The six seats in row 14 appeared to have extra legroom, but they do not recline. The four seats in row 15 are the worst, being both regular seats and having no recline. I don‚Äôt know if that will be considered preferred or regular. Same goes for the four aisle/middle in row 16, although those do recline. The two windows in row 16 are the same unlimited legroom seats that exist today.

o¬†¬† Behind those are another 30 extra legroom seats. Those are followed by the final 54 seats which are the regular seat section.

¬†

I do love this bit about Boarding process:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Southwest is going to keep the boarding poles that it uses today.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As I see it, there are two good reasons for this. First, Southwest already has these poles, and it wouldn‚Äôt be cheap to reconfigure every gate area. Second, this allows Southwest to control the boarding process. It can assign people to different boarding groups and positions to make it easier to get people on the airplane at the right time. This will making boarding go more quickly, and it will get rid of the gate lice that plague other airlines.

¬†

A lot of this information is probably regurgitated but found it very informative. As an ALP (and also someone who is 6‚Äô7‚Äù), I do not have to worry about getting a specific seat or certain seats anymore. For the casual/family flyer, I understand the frustration with the upcharges.

¬†

It somewhat resembles what American has for 737s:

But there are more ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù than a Delta:

zwutrc,2022-12-28 08:14:16,Message from a Southwest First Officer,"Just saw this- 

Copied from my friends wall, he's inflight for Southwest...
To my family and friends who are not in the airline industry or part of Southwest airlines, I have no words to describe what is happening with my company. I want to thank so many of you reaching out to see how I am. 

I am one of the fortunate ones who isn't stuck anywhere but home. I waited on a plane 5 hours on Christmas night at the start of my 3 day trip to just have everything cancelled. Fortunately it was just us Flight Attendants and a Captain waiting for a First Officer that we knew was never going to make it from where he was sitting in Vegas. He was waiting for a flight attendant that was stuck somewhere else. 

Please send out positive vibes to so many of my Co-Hearts still stuck in other cities for days, our airport workers, and all of our passengers who have been affected by this. 

This below was written by one of our First Officers. 

A Southwest First Officer wrote:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say. Southwest Airlines has imploded. Their antiquated software system has completely fried.  Planes are parked. Crews are stranded in the airports with the passengers, volunteering to take the passengers in the parked planes but the software won‚Äôt accept it. Phone lines are overwhelmed for both passenger and crews. I personally spent over two hours trying to get ahold of anyone in the company last night after midnight. A Captain and I did manage to get the one flight put together on Christmas night and got people home. Kudos to the ops agent and dispatcher for making it happen. We had to manually input a lot of the data and it took over an hour to coordinate with dispatch going back and forth running numbers.  

We spent hours trying to get the company to answer and get us a hotel when we landed as they‚Äôre all sold out.  We were only put in a call que for hours before hanging up. I found one hotel with 4 rooms and we bought our own rooms at 2:30am. I even paid for a Flight Attendants room. We literally have crews sleeping on the airport floors all over the country with nowhere to go. Crews have been calling to fly anyone, anywhere, but the company says the system needs a reset. They have effectively shut down the operations for the rest of year, running 1/3 of the flights so that they can let the computer find and locate the crews and aircraft. Gate agents are in tears. They‚Äôve been yelled at, cussed at, slapped and spit on. Flight attendants have been taking a beating. The frontline employees have had little support or communication. Terminals are standing room only with people having been there for days. Pilot lounges are packed with pilots ready to fly and nowhere to go.  

Embarrassing is an understatement. I‚Äôm going on my second of three days off, still stuck on the east coast and still expected to show up in the morning with no schedule. And I‚Äôm willing to fly all day if needed. Because that‚Äôs nothing compared to the passengers needing meds in bags that are lost and mothers traveling with kids, having been stuck for the same amount of days in the terminal.  In 24 years, I‚Äôve never seen anything like this. Heads need to roll! Rumors on media are floating that there is a lack of crews and pilots are staging sick calls.  Absolutely not true at all. This is a computer system meltdown. Thousands of crew members are sitting in hotels and airports with nowhere to go. This airline has failed miserably.‚Äù",DSabLV,373,2330,SouthwestAirlines
1g4adb8,2024-10-15 23:26:31,With new assigned seating coming next year does SW have any plans (or rumors) of larger seats.,"Not talking full first class ""experience"" but seomthing beyond the standard 3+3. Just a couple rows.  Even Spirit of all airlines offers it at this point.  They call it ""big front seat"" which is smart branding because you know it is a bigger nicer seat but it is very much not ""first class"" and you are still on Spirit.  Your expectations are set accordingly.

Right now Southwest ""business"" ticket is pretty lackluster and the only noteable advantage at quite extreme price premium is boarding early but with assigned seats that matters a lot less.  Southwest needs something.  

Put four rows of 2+2 up front in the same space as 5 rows of 3+3.  That reduces seat count by 14 (16 seats in the place of 30 now) and requires tickets be 80% more.  I would gladly pay a 80% premium over Southwest discount rates for a ""first class"" sized seat, earliest boarding, free booze/wifi, dedicated bins, extra points/miles, etc.  I know I can't be the only one.  We use to fly SW when younger and switched to Delta.  However in the last couple years Delta has gotten insane with rising price and falling service.   I would take a second look at SW if they had a ""big seat"" option.

1f8xl78,2024-09-05 00:24:15,Is flying on Southwest really that arduous for people? Am I missing something?,"I fly fairly regularly, and pretty much exclusively on Southwest (thanks, companion pass). First let me say that I am concerned for the future of WN, and that I think all of this talk of ""we surveyed so many people"" is either completely fabricated or they surveyed a *very* carefully selected group. At the same time I feel like I'm not seeing all of these things that the general Reddit public squawks about on this sub. Let's discuss:

* I've come to the conclusion that there are really only 2-3 truly *bad* seats on a Southwest flight (middle in the last row in front of the bathrooms?); all others are more or less equal. Yes, there are some seats that I don't prefer (Bulkhead, exit row with no seat in front, middle), and in general I prefer to sit closer to the front of the plane,  but it's not going to completely ruin my day if I have to sit somewhere less desireable. Even a middle seat isn't really that bad considering most WN flights are 4 hours are less (I did get stuck with a middle seat once on a flight AKL-IAH; that I was not very happy about- but I survived). I don't understand tearing your hair out over a seat like some people here seem to do.
* Granted, I don't really fly in/out of what seem to be the ""preboarder hotspots"" (Last time I set foot in MCO was in 1998), but I'm just not seeing the swarms of ""questionable"" preboarders that people complain about. The last flight I was on a couple days ago had 4 of them: a couple in their 70s who were certainly below average in terms of mobility, a guy with an ortho boot and a knee scooter, and a guy on crutches. 
* Mrs. Carrot is a firm devotee to Early Bird. I am more of what is commonly referred to as a ""cheap bastard."" We've gotten both ""good"" and ""bad"" boarding positions in both scenarios. It helps that we're companion pass, so our boarding positions are always consecutive, but we've never not been able to get 2 seats together (yes, this does frequently involve me sitting in the middle. Love requires sacrifice sometimes, people)
* I've never been told that I couldn't sit somewhere because someone was trying to save the seat.
* Kids. People make a big deal about how ""kids shouldn't be allowed to fly"" and ""there should be adults only flights,"" But again, I don't get why it's such a huge sticking point.  I can't think of a time when kids on a flight truly caused a major disturbance. I sat across from 2 parents and their toddler the other day; and the kid fussed/cried for about 10 minutes total out of the 3.5 hour flight. Other than that you wouldn't have even known he was there. Just like pretty much all other kids I've been on a plane with.
* People seem to hate the ""cattle call"" for boarding. What's the difference between WN and any other airline? You sit at the gate until they call your group, you line up, and then after you wait a few minutes they scan your pass and walk down the jetway. American/Delta/United do the same thing. The main difference with WN is that you can't get to the gate at the last minute, but as discussed earlier, I refuse to let an airline seat ruin my day/trip/life.
* I do not believe that assigned seating will ""fix everything,"" mostly because I don't know what they're trying to fix. I appreciate that I know what I'm getting for the price that I see when I book my ticket and I don't have to worry about paying extra for a bag or a special seat. 
* The couple times that I've had to call them for something they have hands down been the most helpful, friendliest, and easiest to understand customer service people that I've maybe ever dealt with

So what's the deal? Why are people so bent out of shape? Is there something I've missed? Do I have the world's best luck when it comes to flying? Or am I just somehow more zen than I ever believed? Someone make it make sense.",Inquisitive-Carrot,220,283,SouthwestAirlines
1dq1ndu,2024-06-28 04:44:14,"Me: 1, seat-saver: 0","Edit: maybe the title should be 0.5 and 0.5, since he did end up injuring me

Allow me to set the scene for you: 

We are lined up to begin boarding at DEN heading to the East Coast. I am in ljne at my position A2. 

This boomer couple are first in line to preboard with an elderly woman, I assume she is mother to one of them. The gate agent correctly tells them that only one adult can preboard with mom. They huff and puff and eventually the wife wanders off to board normally. 

Preboards board. General boarding begins. I get on board and come across a solo purse in 4C. Row is empty. The husband is in 3C alone in his row, grandma is across the aisle in 3D, also alone. I ask if this is his belonging, he says ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs. She is sitting there.‚Äù Well, sir, I saw you at the gate. She‚Äôs not on the plane. 

So, obviously, I move the purse and sit down. When the husband finally notices, he freaks out, saying ‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôre just going to MOVE MY THINGS, THEN JUST GIVE IT TO ME.‚Äù I give him the purse and put in my headphones while he is loudly complaining about how inconsiderate people are. 

Was the wife A group? No. Was the wife early B group? No. By the time she finally boards, the husband has told 4 different people he is saving the middle seat next to him for his wife - just to illustrate how many people have gotten on board before the wife shows. Not only was he trying to save the middle seat the whole time (honestly, fine, who cares), but he really thought he could save an aisle seat in row 4 (now my seat) for someone in late B/C group??? 

She declines the middle seat next to him and takes an aisle seat at the back of the plane. (What a gentleman, he lets her stay back there and doesn‚Äôt switch aisle seats to let her sit at the front.)

The best part: he goes to the back to use the restroom mid-flight, and on his way back to his seat he uses his full weight to body check himself into my shoulder as hard as he can.

zxg6op,2022-12-29 01:58:58,The history of SWA destruction from within.,"/forward 

&amp;#x200B;

What happened to Southwest Airlines?

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve been a pilot for Southwest Airlines for over 35 years. I‚Äôve given my heart and soul to Southwest Airlines during those years. And quite honestly Southwest Airlines has given its heart and soul to me and my family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many of you have asked what caused this epic meltdown. Unfortunately, the frontline employees have been watching this meltdown coming like a slow motion train wreck for sometime. And we‚Äôve been begging our leadership to make much needed changes in order to avoid it. What happened yesterday started two decades ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Herb Kelleher was the brilliant CEO of SWA until 2004. He was a very operationally oriented leader. Herb spent lots of time on the front line. He always had his pulse on the day to day operation and the people who ran it. That philosophy flowed down through the ranks of leadership to the front line managers. We were a tight operation from top to bottom. We had tools, leadership and employee buy in. Everything that was needed to run a first class operation. When Herb retired in 2004 Gary Kelly became the new CEO. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gary was an accountant by education and his style leading Southwest Airlines became more focused on finances and less on operations. He did not spend much time on the front lines. He didn‚Äôt engage front line employees much. When the CEO doesn‚Äôt get out in the trenches the neither do the lower levels of leadership. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gary named another accountant to be Chief Operating Officer (the person responsible for day to day operations). The new COO had little or no operational background. This trickled down through the lower levels of leadership, as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

They all disengaged the operation, disengaged the employees and focused more on Return on Investment, stock buybacks and Wall Street. This approach worked for Gary‚Äôs first 8 years because we were still riding the strong wave that Herb had built. 

&amp;#x200B;

But as time went on the operation began to deteriorate. There was little investment in upgrading technology (after all, how do you measure the return on investing in infrastructure?) or the tools we needed to operate efficiently and consistently. As the frontline employees began to see the deterioration in our operation we began to warn our leadership. We educated them, we informed them and we made suggestions to them. But to no avail. The focus was on finances not operations. As we saw more and more deterioration in our operation our asks turned to pleas. Our pleas turned to dire warnings. But they went unheeded. After all, the stock price was up so what could be wrong? 

&amp;#x200B;

We were a motivated, willing and proud employee group wanting to serve our customers and uphold the tradition of our beloved airline, the airline we built and the airline that the traveling public grew to cheer for and luv. But we were watching in frustration and disbelief as our once amazing airline was becoming a house of cards. 

&amp;#x200B;

A half dozen small scale meltdowns occurred during the mid to late 2010‚Äôs. With each mini meltdown Leadership continued to ignore the pleas and warnings of the employees in the trenches. We were still operating with 1990‚Äôs technology. We didn‚Äôt have the tools we needed on the line to operate the sophisticated and large airline we had become. We could see that the wheels were about ready to fall off the bus. But no one in leadership would heed our pleas. 

&amp;#x200B;

When COVID happened SWA scaled back considerably (as did all of the airlines) for about two years. This helped conceal the serious problems in technology, infrastructure and staffing that were occurring and being ignored. But as we ramped back up the lack of attention to the operation was waiting to show its ugly head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gary Kelly retired as CEO in early 2022. Bob Jordan was named CEO. He was a more operationally oriented leader. He replaced our Chief Operating Officer with a very smart man and they announced their priority would be to upgrade our airline‚Äôs technology and provide the frontline employees the operational tools we needed to care for our customers and employees. Finally, someone acknowledged the elephant in the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

But two decades of neglect takes several years to overcome. And, unfortunately to our horror, our house of cards came tumbling down this week as a routine winter storm broke our 1990‚Äôs operating system. 

&amp;#x200B;

The frontline employees were ready and on station. We were properly staffed. We were at the airports. Hell, we were ON the airplanes. But our antiquated software systems failed coupled with a decades old system of having to manage 20,000 frontline employees by phone calls. No automation had been developed to run this sophisticated machine. 

&amp;#x200B;

We had a routine winter storm across the Midwest last Thursday. A larger than normal number flights were cancelled as a result. But what should have been one minor inconvenient day of travel turned into this nightmare. After all, American, United, Delta and the other airlines operated with only minor flight disruptions. 

&amp;#x200B;

The two decades of neglect by SWA leadership caused the airline to lose track of all its crews. ALL of us. We were there. With our customers. At the jet. Ready to go. But there was no way to assign us. To confirm us. To release us to fly the flight. And we watched as our customers got stranded without their luggage missing their Christmas holiday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that our new CEO Bob Jordan inherited a MESS. This meltdown was not his failure but the failure of those before him. I believe he has the right priorities. But it will take time to right this ship. A few years at a minimum. Old leaders need to be replaced. Operationally oriented managers need to be brought in. I hope and pray Bob can execute on his promises to fix our once proud airline. Time will tell. 

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs been a punch in the gut for us frontline employees. We care for the traveling public. We have spent our entire careers serving you. Safely. Efficiently. With luv and pride. We are horrified. We are sorry. We are sorry for the chaos, inconvenience and frustration our airline caused you. We are angry. We are embarrassed. We are sad. Like you, the traveling public, we have been let down by our own leaders.

Is it worth it if I dont live in a focus city? I'm in Seattle, and most of my usual destinations are Non-stopped by United and Alaska, and I've never visited any of the cities that Southwest can Non-stop me to. Because of that, Southwest's flights from/to Seattle are usually more expensive due to them stopping somewhere (which is ironic since they are a ""low-cost"" carrier).

My only experience with them was a TPA-&gt;DEN-&gt;SEA flight (pre A-List promo) and I had no complaints, but the value of the company looks hazy due to the seating program being changed which seems the be the best part for a single traveler like me.

Also, Southwest doesn't even fly ***AT ALL*** to a couple cities I travel to, like GNV, EWR or YYZ. I know I might not be the right customer for them but there are A LOT of perks so it's hard to gauge if it's worthwhile for me.

I explain how embarrassing, cheap, and rude her behavior is, she has nothing to say but sorry. Flight attendant 2 rows up stay out of it as expected. We sit In the row across From her.

Somehow her seat saving works for the full flight, no one else tried to take any of her 3x4 seating arrangement as far as I can tell.

As someone that is stranded in Houston and personally waited in line to speak to a gate agent (while on the hold with Southwest Vacations for over 3 hours), I can assure you the majority of their 2,900 cancellations were not weather related. 

My cancelled flight was from Orlando to Las Vegas with a stop in Houston to drop off and add more passengers. Same crew and plane was to continue to Vegas. Got cancelled in Houston with no explanation given, and no option to destination or back home to Orlando.

***UPDATE***
Me and family drove back to Orlando FL in. rental vehicle on 12/28/2022. Over 13 hour drive, darn that I-10 is a straight road. 

Have submitted complaint to DOT and have yet to hear from SWA about the cancelled flight or how they are going to make it right.  $500 in hotel bills and $1400 for rental car and gas, plus the original $2300 flight hotel package so I‚Äôm out $4200 so far for a non-existent vacation.

I have not flown Southwest in a while and I have a 1 year old who will be traveling for the first time. 

I wanted her to have her own seat and used by companion pass. My husband and I upgraded to a business select ticket (bought extra points during their current sale to cover it) and then added her as a companion to ensure we all sat together, but didn't realize it was entirely possible that my daughter could get Group C boarding!   I also completely forgot about family boarding!  She is 1, so she obviously cannot just wait by herself. I called SWA and several agents told me it all depends on the agent at the gate if they'll let my 1 year old board with us in the A1-15 group. 

I downgraded both of our  tickets to wanna get away to get the points back and will just board with family boarding, which will be before Group B-this  will still be able to ensure we all sit together.

I'd venture to say at this time, if you have ANY dates booked at ANY time in the future (at the very least, as far out as WN's calendar currently extends), the answer is YES.

I have a friend in Lahaina, where many of the Maui resorts are. She and her family &amp; friends were able to leave the island safely, but she's an employee of one of the major resorts and has been posting regular updates on social media. The thing most people haven't wrapped their heads around yet is *the entire city of Lahaina is gone.* Us outsiders are treating this like a hurricane where utilties get restored, windows get replaced, roofs get repaired, maybe some water damage is remediated, and a few weeks later we're back in business. The reality is *a lot of the tourist areas have been completely, totally wiped off the map* which is really hard to fathom in a country like the USA. So this isn't a disaster recovery at all. It's a total, clean-sheet, square-one rebuild. This means years, perhaps decades.

Which presents a unique opportunity for the natives of Hawaii. While tourism is the lifeblood of the local economy, to many of them, the money doesn't really matter. They would prefer just do without, or at least severely limit the tourism that takes place. The status quo has been allowed to persist for decades and decades because nothing's really happened to challenge it. *Faced with a clean-sheet rebuild, it's unlikely they will ever rebuild these areas, at least in the form we once knew them*. It's likely a town like Lahaina could potentially be re-imagined as a bedroom community with strict limitations on vacation rentals. They've wanted to limit tourism for years; now's their chance.

Time will tell if I'm right, or if they just go and build another Hyatt. Either way, none of this is happening within WN's current calendar; construction takes time, so any current bookings, you should be making alternate plans.",BluejayAppropriate35,112,439,SouthwestAirlines

1fyl4ig,2024-10-08 06:53:18,Highest probability of open middle seat?,"I've always thought about what seat I should pick when my goal is to have an empty middle seat. Comfort is my first priority and I fly with two carry-ons so I don't like taking up the exit rows. I have typically noticed that the front and back of the plane always fills up, with some scattered empty middle seats. Anyone have any theories of which seats might have the highest probability of open middle seat if the flight isn't full?

My theory:
The first 10 rows will probably never have an empty middle seat unless all the middle seats are empty. There are always people who will prefer to get off the plane as early as possible.

If the flight is busy, people will move towards the back hoping they can find a empty window or aisle seat. Once they can see there are no window or aisle seats, they will pick whatever the nearest seat is without going back, that's why I think the last 5 rows will also fill up.

Now the question is whether people start giving up hope for an aisle or window seat in rows 10-15 or 15-20. What do you guys think?

ATL: The market here has been unsatisfactory over the last couple of years and we will be cutting almost 70% of flights here. Southwest Airlines Atlanta will be losing the following cities beginning in April: CLE, FLL, GSP, JAN, JAX, MEM, MIA, MKE, OKC, OMA, PHL, RIC, RSW, SDF, and SRQ. However this is not entirely a total loss as some of these routes will be moved to surrounding stations such as BNA, BWI, MCO.

DEN: This one is more or less a rumor but a slight routing realignment is expected between DEN and LAS. Though insignificant to the consumer this would however dethrone DEN as Southwest Airlines largest station in the system by flight count. This may or may not also remove some routes from DEN entirely. More research is required here.

Intrastate California: Yes the rumors are true, however this seems to be more of a shuffle between cities rather than cutting routes entirely. What routes will be affected is not available at the moment.

Hawaii: As [previously mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/s/mRfwBeIsaz), Southwest Hawaii will be serving Redeye flights to the mainland. This unfortunately has a downside as inter-island and mainland frequency adjustments are coming with it beginning in April. HNL &lt;-&gt; LAX,SJC,OAK: frequency will be reducing down to one flight daily to and from. OGG &lt;-&gt; LAS,SJC,SMF: LAS to OGG will reduce to one flight daily however one of the OGG to LAS daily flights will be turned into the redeye. Service for OGG &lt;-&gt; SJC,SMF will reduce to weekends only. As for inter-island service, the routes the seem to be affected will be HNL &lt;-&gt; OGG,KOA, and LIH. By how much is not known.

BNA: Southwest Airlines Nashville will be expanding its network as it add the following daily service routes beginning in April: ALB, JAN, MEM, TUL, and returning service to ABQ. Service to SLC will also increase to daily flights as well as the return of GRR on Sundays only. Some frequency increases include: ATL, BOS, CHS, CLT, CMH, MCO, PNS, RDU, and SAN. 

Other notable add ons: MCO will return service to RIC and SAN as well as include new service to ORD. This also includes a frequency increase to SMF. CHS to STL and GSP to HOU will now become daily routes along with JAX to STL. The return of PHL to DAL and BUF to RSW will also be added as weekday only flights.",A_Slavic_Inktoling,84,45,SouthwestAirlines

1fw98t2,2024-10-05 04:40:45,Southwest drops the ball over and over and over again!,"     So, on Tuesday, 10/1, my 88-year old mother-in-law was flying from Phoenix, AZ to Buffalo, NY to come visit her grandson, his in-laws, her son, and me. We were driving 2 1/2 hours each way to pick her up, as Buffalo is the airport with non-stop flights that is closest to said grandson‚Äôs house. We purchased her Southwest tickets for her weeks ago. 
     When she got to the Southwest desk and gave them her ID and flight information, they took her checked bag and issued her a boarding pass. As the gentleman wheeled her away from the desk, (she needs a wheelchair assist to get through the airport) she noticed that the boarding pass had someone else‚Äôs name and destination on it! She let the gentleman know, and he told her it was ‚Äúfine‚Äù. She kept saying no, it‚Äôs not fine, but he just kept wheeling her to security. She reported to the security folks that the name on the boarding pass wasn‚Äôt her, and they assured her that it was ‚Äúfine‚Äù and processed her through to the gates. She finally had had enough and caused enough of a fuss that someone listened to her. The assistant wheeled her back to the Southwest desk, where they begrudgingly issued her her correct boarding pass. 
     She asked about her checked bag, and they assured her that it would get on the right plane. On her second pass through security, they pulled her and wiped her hands and told her she tested positive for GSR. She didn‚Äôt have any issues going through the first time, and she‚Äôs an 88 year old woman with very limited mobility. The only things she had touched since her last trip through security were her DL &amp; the arms of their wheelchair, which means if she had acquired GSR on her hand, it was from their wheelchair! She complained about that, as she hasn‚Äôt touched a gun in the last 50 years, let alone the last 40 minutes, and the guy pushing the wheelchair told her that all the delays and the ‚ÄúGSR‚Äù were all her fault and got snotty with her. 
     She finally makes it to the gate, boards her flight, and has an uneventful flight to NY. They wheel her to baggage claim, where my husband and I meet her. We wait and watch as all of the luggage comes out and is taken by the other passengers. No bag. We go to the baggage office, where we are assisted by a very kind woman. At first she can‚Äôt locate the bag in the system. Then she finds it - on the ramp to go to CA! She tells us that since the CA flight has been delayed for many hours her bag is still in Phoenix. She calls that airport, and they agree to go pull the bag immediately and get it on the next flight to Buffalo. This means it should arrive in NY around 3 or 4 pm the next day and that it should get to Oswego that night. Great. We just have to buy her pajamas and clothes for the next day. 
     Fast forward to yesterday, 10/3. Wr have heard nothing from Southwest and the website we were given just shows her bag as ‚Äúin transit‚Äù with no other information. So, we call Southwest, only to learn that her bag flew to CA, and was on its way back to Phoenix. It should arrive that night in Oswego. Now we‚Äôre at today. Still no sign of her luggage!  Got a message from Southwest this morning. They don‚Äôt have anyone that goes out this far to deliver her luggage, so they‚Äôre sending it FedEx and it should arrive by the end of the day tomorrow! Literally all of her clothing and personal care items are in that bag. We have had to purchase her 4 days worth of everything, and hope to get at least a partial refund from Southwest.          
     They offered her NOTHING to make up for all of this. This is one more reason I refuse to ever fly Southwest myself, and, even though it is her preferred airline, I can‚Äôt see us booking her on them again either. This whole debacle was so easily avoidable - all they had to do was listen to her at the desk and check her name against the boarding pass they were issuing. The fact that she made it all the way through security with someone else‚Äôs boarding pass is frightening to me. How can we trust all of the safety measures when no one caught something so obvious - especially since she kept telling everyone that it was wrong. 
5 days of a 7 day trip with no luggage. Ugh!!!

1e4p4r2,2024-07-16 21:49:10,Flight attendant denied passenger use of 2 seats she paid for because she wasn‚Äôt in a cast,"Article is below, but here are the main points.

Passenger pays for two seats to allow her to keep her knee more straight in a brace due to an injury from an accident. 

Another man boards and wants her second seat and she declines. FA initially says she can't have the second seat because she's not in a cast (??). 

Other passengers begin arguing that she should or shouldn't give up the seat. Passenger calls her assistant who tells her to record everything, but she doesn't (yet; she records once off the plane). 

FA attempts to move her to an emergency exit row, which is inappropriate for a disabled person who can't assist in an emergency.

Passenger is removed from flight for other customers' comfort because she doesn't want to give up the second seat she PAID FOR.

Passenger missed her work meeting and is out multiple hundreds dollars on a car service that was waiting on the other side, as SW would only refund her plane ticket.

What do you think? I am disabled and pay to fly either upgraded or for a second seat and this kind of stuff makes me so angry. If she paid for a second seat to accommodate a disability, that should be the end of the story; it's her seat. She's exploring legal options re: ADA and I support her. This kind of thing happens way too frequently.",1K_Sunny_Crew,361,2877,SouthwestAirlines

My KC flight was delayed 30 minutes which made my Denver layover all of 15 minutes. I was worried then relieved when I got the notification that my Denver flight was now an hour behind.  Imagine my surprise when I get a notification as soon as I board my flight that the Denver flight we rebooked onto a flight 3.5 hours later. As soon as I landed I went to my gate and asked to be put on my original flight that wasn‚Äôt boarding yet only to be told it was full and there were 7 people in standby ahead of me.  The gate agent was understanding but reminded me quickly that because this was weather I could try to file a claim but it wasn‚Äôt policy to reimburse.

1f2nc01,2024-08-28 01:47:04,Hybrid Boarding Proposal,"So assigned seating is coming. Some like it, some don‚Äôt, especially business travelers. What if they blocked off the last 2 rows in the back for ‚Äúopen seating‚Äù? 

The idea is that if you want an assigned seat you can pay for it. If you don‚Äôt want to pay for it, you‚Äôll be assigned a seat automatically, usually a middle seat. If the plane is completely sold out 12 people will randomly be given Open Seating which they can‚Äôt complain about because they didn‚Äôt pay for assigned seats. Obviously any unsold seats will remain in the Open Seating section. 

For business travelers, who often make same day and last minute changes, they can opt into the Open Seating seats. The boarding order for the 12 people assigned Open Seating will be similar to it is now. If a business select seat is purchased and opted into Open Seating, they go first. Then ALP followed by AL and then random luck of the draw. Also, the last overhead bin on each side will remain assigned to the Open Seating seats. 

This will help ensure that business travelers can still get a window or aisle seat, albeit in the back of the plane, when they change their flights.

If we miss the connection and need to wait a day, it is not going to put a huge crimp in our travels, as we don't have anything pressing in New Orleans. 

Should I take it? What will happen if we, through no fault of our own, miss this short connect? Does Southwest put us up in a hotel if the next flight to New Orleans is not until the next day?

My main concern is that, if we miss the flight, Southwest will not pay anything and will just say it was our fault for booking something with too close of a connection (even though it is their software that selected that flight with that short connection). If I end up having to pay for a hotel and a rental car, it will make the flight about as expensive as a flight with a reasonable layover (but at a much worse time of the day, as in, wake up at 3:30am).
