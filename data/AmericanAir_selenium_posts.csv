My husband and I booked two tickets to Amsterdam through American air and wanted to pay to upgrade to buisness. (we did this two weeks ago with our flights to Ireland next year) the banner to upgrade wasn’t on the app so we called customer service. They told us that our tickets were actually British air.. BUT when we called British air, they said they tickets were American air.. any advice?

1cfekj1,2024-04-29 03:21:29,How do I get credit for my miles flown?,"I’ll try to be brief, I took a flight on American Airlines ticket and a partner airline, Qatar in Jan/Feb. Booked as an AA flight.   It was a business class ticket with 6 segments. I have gotten credit for 5 of the 6 segments but one segment, which is 20,000 miles alone AA keeps declining. The reason is because they say Qatar (4 of the segments) airlines applied that one segment alone to my Qatar FF account (I didn’t even know I had a Qatar FF account) but apparently I did and it shows a zero balance. I called Qatar and they confirmed that Qatar applied the other three correctly to my American Airlines account and never applied any points to my Qatar account. So, twice I have escalated this to AA  and twice they declined this even though I sent them a screenshot of the Qatar account with a zero balance. I’m so close to my 2M miles and I really need this 20,000 miles. Does anyone know how to escalate this to someone who will actually help me?  ",ravenbythesea,2,1,AmericanAir

14ppiuc,2023-07-04 01:36:31,Issues with Compensation for Repeatedly Cancelled Flights,"In March, my mother, my sister, and I flew direct from Dallas to Auckland, New Zealand. We were scheduled to return to Dallas direct from Auckland on a Sunday. After getting through security and waiting for 3 hours, our flight was completely cancelled.  

We were told that the next flight would be on Tuesday, and that all of our meals and the hotel would be covered until then. We were shuttled to a hotel near the airport and given a voucher for dinner. The next day, we were moved to a different hotel, and again received a voucher for dinner. They did not cover breakfast or lunch, and the move was a bit of an inconvenience.   

We arrived at the airport for our rescheduled flight on Tuesday, and waited in line to check in for over 2 hours - and then that flight was cancelled as well. As we needed to get home for work, I immediately called American directly and got rebooked on another airline with two layovers (much less convenient than our direct flight, but better than waiting another 2 days for the flight they wanted to put us on).   

Since then, I have been emailing with one person from American’s Customer Relations team. It took them over a month to even respond to my inquiry regarding reimbursement for the additional meals and expenses (there is no phone number for this department, believe it or not) and after all of that, they are offering us each a $100 flight credit.   

I was caught up in the Southwest meltdown in December, and while that was riddled with issues, each of us did receive a $250 flight voucher plus 25,000 Southwest points. That was also handled much more promptly than this issue.   

I understand that flying is a gamble, but we missed three days of work, paid for additional pet boarding and food, and were never offered anything for our trouble until I reached out to American directly.",mathprof918,0,2,AmericanAir

I tried calling AA and Qatar, and I’ve been having contradictory answers from the agents. Please not the AA is Envoy AIR (American Eagle), those really tiny plane.

If I have to, is it a fairly simple process for transit re-check passengers, or do I have to go to the baggage claim area and then wait for my bags to arrive then take them to other area and get them weighed again and get them checked in? Will I have to go through the security again considering I have to recollect my bag and check-in again, or do they have designated process for transit passengers and I just pickup from near my chicago gate and just drop off near my T5 internstional gate?

I asked the gate agent if there were enough empty seats  for me to have a complimentary car seat seat. The gate agent said sure no problem and I’ll also give you a whole row to yourself. Anyways I’m situated with my daughter in her car seat (she’s 1 and I’m flying alone with her) and a different gate agent comes up and says “you’ll need to check that” and I was like “oh actually the gate agent told me I could use it for my car seat I asked her before the flight” and she said “no you can’t you didn’t pay for the seat. I was like what does that matter if it’s empty anyways? And she goes you didn’t pay for it and you can’t use it. I’ll give you a minute to get situated  and come back for it. I decided not to make a scene and try to enjoy the rest of my flight but my car seat fits in the overhead compartment so I put it up there (again this is a virtually empty flight  so there was no shortage of bin space). She comes back and says, exactly like this,  “get your car seat out for me”. And I said so now it can’t be in the overhead bin? And she goes no because you didn’t pay for it. Holding my 1 year old I open it up and she goes “get it out for me”. Wtf???! I’m holding my baby!?!? Anyways the lady behind me goes that’s enough you’re just being nasty now and gets it down for me. 

My question is - is this a legitimate thing? I would understand if maybe there was some sort of liability thing related to the usage of the seat? But I have done this same thing on empty southwest flights with no problem. Despite that, there’s no reason I couldn’t put my car seat in the overhead compartment.

1dlytjy,2024-06-22 23:56:50,Dissatisfied,"I have been flying American Airlines solely for about 20 years. But have noticed a shift in their policies, processes, and customer satisfaction. 

1.They refuse to return a travel credit of $525 that we were forced to cancel the ticket and rebook due to a glitch at booking in their system. The credit expired and per their policy cannot be re-instated under any circumstances. There was never a prompt or reminder that this credit was coming to expiration. The one time I tried to apply the credit to a booking flying to London, the system had a ""glitch"" and I was not able to apply. I see a recurring theme here. 

2. Their call centers are overseas and the reps are never able to resolve any issue. Their only response to a request is a standard ""NO"". No matter what the circumstance, usually some error with the app or website. Requesting to speak with an agent here in the US, am told they are unable to transfer me. I make the request because I usually have better luck. 

3. I opened an American Airlines Executive Mastercard with a promotion offer of 40k miles and $200 statement credit for spending $5k within 90 days which I met the requirement and never recieved the credit. I have made several attempts to resolve, they simply will not honor the offer. 

4. I have 5 vouchers for seat upgrades that I have attempted to use multiple times at booking but the app/website never gives you the option to apply at booking. These may only be applied at time of booking and I have never been able to use them. Calling in you hold for 45 minutes and then their agents say there is nothing they can do because I have already completed the booking. 

5. They email your offers for rental cars and such. I've tried twice to book one of these offers and both times when I went to pick up the rental, the company had nothing in their system for the reservation. Even though I was able to show them proof of booking and the special price... both times I was told they did not have that price available. The Advantage Desk was no help as they were not open to assist and no other department could help.

My bag is from Nordstrom and it was around $350 but they’re only trying to give me $125. Their website says they cover up to $3800 if it’s a domestic flight and I provide everything they need but now they want a receipt which I do not have because the luggage was a gift. I don’t see anywhere on the website that this is part of the process and I’m wondering if anyone else has gone through this.

I’ve had the worst time with my case owner, she has terrible communication and I have not been able to get a hold of her. You can easily see that no luggage on Nordstrom‘s website is that price and all I want is something similar for what I had, but she keeps saying they don’t replace, just give the cost of your bag but I need a receipt. 

Any tips? I’m not asking to receive the fanciest bag, but at least something similar for damaging my bag. And I have not heard of many other people needing to do this much especially when it’s not me asking for the 3800. Such a shit company with shit customer service. ",gemnextdior,2,4,AmericanAir

ywjoyz,2022-11-16 12:29:04,Layover times?,"I am planning to fly in the south and for the tickets I am looking at two options. For the cheapest ticket, the flight on my way back has a 45 min layover at O'hare airport, while the second cheapest which is 85 dollars more has a 1hr 11min layover at Charolette Douglas. I haven't been to both of these airports and I want to take the cheapest however I am worried about the 45 min layover as a slight delay to there could really screw me over and I am aware that the O'hare airport is huge, so I am wondering if its worth just paying 85 dollars extra to have more time on getting to my flight or just risk it and see I can make it. I know I can get connected to another flight if I miss it, but I don't really wanna deal with the delayed hours getting connected to another flight.",Keepergoing,2,1,AmericanAir

I had my boarding pass and a seat assignment but when my pass was scanned it was showing I had not checked in and therefore, that I had no seat. I had checked in, and had my boarding pass and seat assignment to prove it, but was denied boarding and told there was nothing they could do about it. I filled out a complaint and request for compensation but am being told I do not qualify because it was “not an oversold flight.” They offered $200 for the “inconvenience” which does not even cover the additional cost for the hotel and Uber that I had to obtain, not to mention, the interference with my work schedule. I’m a bit flabbergasted and unsure how to proceed. I feel as though there is plenty of proof that I followed all necessary protocol and that this was an AA error and not mine, but despite this, AA seems to be dodging accountability and adequate compensation. Any advice would be much appreciated- thank you!",Cheezburgerwithfries,3,1,AmericanAir

I've got a buddy that wants me to book his flight together with mine for an upcoming trip, mainly so he can get my companion benefits. Assuming I do this, and put us both in MCE seats -- if I was to call AA and have them separate the record locators, would he still get my status benefits? (e.g., checked bags, etc.) I don't mind booking the flights to get him in a better seat and a free checked bag, but I don't want to miss out on an upgrade being tied to him (non-status holder). Hopefully that makes sense.

How should I handle this?","I am out of the country and am flying home via AA and through Miami. I just decided to divert at my MIA layover to visit friends for Thanksgiving before I head home so I bought a new flight on Southwest from MIA to my new destination, and intend to abandon the second leg of my AA journey home. There are two of us traveling (separate record locators), and both of us plan to divert. 

I've heard about the risks of skip-lagging, and don't want to get into trouble with AA. How should I handle this? Maybe I should let a gate agent know that we're not able to travel home on the second leg (instead of staying quiet). Are there risks? Is there something special I should tell them? 

Not that it matters, but my decision to divert has nothing to do with saving money (it's costing me more to divert). I just wanted to visit friends who are closer to my layover in Miami than to my home city.

   * No (except for Hawaii has special rules that are constantly). No proof of vaccine is needed to fly domestically, you will be required to wear a mask during your flight.
* Are they serving food and alcohol on the plane?
   * Currently, only first-class will receive be served food and consume alcohol. If you are flying in the main cabin, packing a snack is suggested.
* My flight was delayed, what can I do to get compensation?
   * If your flight is delayed for weather reasons, you will not receive any compensation. If it was delayed for maintenance or another reason, you can complain to AA and will likely receive miles. If your flight is pushed to the next day, they will put you up in a hotel for the night.
* My bag didn't make it with me, what should I do?
   * You must go to the baggage claim office at the airport. You may purchase clothing and toiletries. Keep the receipts and you will be reimbursed later. It will likely take a month from when the form is submitted to when you receive a check in the mail.
* I purchased a non refundable fare ticket and now I can't go, what are my options?
   * If you booked a basic economy ticket, there is nothing that can be done.
   * If your ticket is not a basic economy ticket, you can cancel the flight for a credit. This can be done in the app or on the website.
   * If you purchased travel insurance, you must go through the insurance agency, not AA.
* I booked a ticket through \*insert anyone besides AA\* and I need to make a change how do I do this?
   * You must contact the agency you booked the ticket with. They ""own"" the rights to that ticket and need to make and changes unless it is the day of travel, then AA can help you. It is ideal to always buy directly from AA to avoid 3rd party rules.",glockymcglockface,2,2,AmericanAir
