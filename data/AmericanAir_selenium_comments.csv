1. If you‚Äôre checking bags, they will not be checked all the way through &amp; will be a nightmare getting out of security to claim &amp; recheck them for your next flight. 3 hours may not be enough. 

2. Because your flights are not connected, if there is a delay on your first flight, they will NOT provide accommodations during delay or automatically rebook for the next leg. This will also be a nightmare as the JFK-DOH flight on AA is very often delayed. I know from personal experience it has been delayed over 12 hours the last two days.

3. Schedule changes are very likely from here to December that may shorten that connection time which may cause you not to have enough time between connections.

ka4vavf,2023-11-21 07:21:15,"I‚Äôm concerned they might reprice the trip to end in Miami. This close to the departure, the new price will be like buying a last minute ticket, which could be a much higher fare. OP can use the ‚Äúchange flight‚Äù option to test if it will cost more before deciding whether to cancel the last leg.

If it ends up costing more, I would just leave it alone. As long as OP doesn‚Äôt make a habit of skiplagging, likely there will be no consequence to doing it just this once.

Also, it probably goes without saying, but do not check any bags on this flight. Also there is a risk if OP is not in an early boarding group, that it‚Äôs a full flight so they should understand there‚Äôs a risk of being required to gate check a carryon.",TrowTruck,1,1801qan,ka30uz8

If these are FLIGHT CREDITS They must be **traveled** by expiration  date (and by you and you alone).  If they are TRIP credits they can be used for a trip anytime in the bookable future (and can be used to book travel for someone else).

kk7jxvl,2024-01-30 11:34:15,"How much is each ticket worth?

If these are what AA calls ‚Äúflight credits,‚Äù here‚Äôs an example of how you can extend at least some of the value of these:

 * Example, you have a ‚Äúflight credit‚Äù worth $500.
 * Find the cheapest one-way flight between any two cities. I believe it can‚Äôt be a basic economy fair, but main cabin is fine.
 * After booking, AA will issue you a trip credit for the difference in price. This credit will be good for one year from the date it is issued.
 * If you‚Äôre not going to use the one-way flight, cancel the one-way flight.

You‚Äôll likely get the one-way flight price back in a flight credit with the origins expiration date, but the rest of the money will be on a new credit that you have a whole other year to use.",TrowTruck,1,1ae7yib,na

But last week it was bouncing around all over the place from 46.5 to 80, constantly.  I just don't get what the pricing algorithm is looking at.  But, I swear they know when you are in there checking routes and instantly jack rates up.  That seems highly unfair.  I could see day to day changes but this is pure price gouging.
