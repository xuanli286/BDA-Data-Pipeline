SWA is running 737-800s and MAX8s in situations where a smaller 700 series would be better -- but they are retiring the 700s with no direct replacement due to MAX7 delays. \n\nOP isn't wrong. Boeing is a hot mess. The MAX7 isn't likely to fly for years at this point, if it even happens at all. It's a shining example of what's wrong with American manufacturing.\n\nThe Embraer E-jets such as E195-E2 are worth consideration.They are a smaller alternative for the MAX7. \n\nAnother option is buying an airline with a large 737 fleet such as Sun Country. I couldn't imagine the Feds blocking that merger due to Sun Country's small size as an airline. But that still doesn't help with getting 700 series 737s because Sun Country runs 800s and has a handful of 900s which SWA probably wouldn't know what to do with. \n\nIt's obvious that SWA is going to have to bite the bullet and move to either Airbus A320-series NEOs or E195-E2s or Airbus A220-200s. Unless they start a Tech Ops program like Delta, running old jets like it's Cuba or something, that's their only options. \n\nRelying on Boeing will only give more fuel to Eliott.\n\nEdit: typo", "username": "No_Huckleberry_1789", "score": 0, "post_id": "1g6vm6u", "parent_id": "t3_1g6vm6u"}, {"id": "lso14m9", "date": "2024-10-19 18:50:30", "content": "The problem is Airbus has a backlog of deliveries reaching well into the 2030\u2019s for existing customers.

Renting car seats with rental car companies is a huge gamble, I\u2019ve hear stories of there only being infant seats available for a 4yo or missing buckles. You are also welcome to check the car seat either 1) with your checked luggage before security or 2) at the gate where you drop it off right before you step on the plane and pick it up in the same spot when you get off. There\u2019s a small risk of it getting lost or damaged if you check it. But it does not count against your two free checked bags. \n\nIf grandma is picking you up from the airport and already has a reliable car seat, you can forego brining a car seat altogether. In any other circumstance I personally bring the cosco finale (or scenera) on the plane with us and strap my kiddo into a window seat for the flight. \n\nOh one last thing - if you choose not to go the cosco car seat route, you need to triple check the car seat you bring is approved for airplane use.

Southwest has half of Concourse C and 19 gates (downsizing to 11).  Even prior to this announcement, they were flying 60% fewer flights out of Atlanta than AirTran did.  Now I see a ton of Frontier and Spirit planes at ATL on the D and E concourses.  They\u2019re not having any issues competing with Delta.  Let me put it like this - if AirTran had 6 flights per day from Fort Lauderdale or Miami to ATL, Southwest came in and eventually got down to three flights per day, but those flights were packed full.  Then they moved the flight times to one leaving out of FLL at 6 AM, the second at 5 PM, and the third at 10 PM - well guess what?  Nobody wants to fly at those times of the day regardless if the return flight is at a decent time, so they\u2019ll book Delta or Spirit or anything that flies out at a time they need.  So now the flights are desolate (I was on a 6 AM ghost flight out of Fort Myers to ATL the other day with 8 other passengers).  \n\nScrew Boeing - that isn\u2019t the issue.  Southwest\u2019s aircraft utilization is already among the lowest in the industry - they\u2019re not flying their existing planes enough and now say they\u2019re going to start selling off aircraft to other airlines (and not talking about the 737-700 dinosaurs but 737-800 and 737-8 Max), potentially selling Boeing delivery slots instead of taking deliveries, and talking about selling jets to leasing companies and then leasing them back to make cash in the short-term while spending more in the long-term.\n\nTheir lame excuses suck.  If they didn\u2019t want the East Coast and Florida, they shouldn\u2019t have bought AirTran, simple as that.  They can\u2019t compete because they\u2019re freaking idiots.  Elliott are bigger idiots who will only make things worse, but at this time, I\u2019m only focused on the stock price so I can get out at a decent level to break even.

I do indeed know what I\u2019m talking about.  \n\nThe vast majority of aircraft they\u2019re sending to BHM are not near their D-checks (a D-check can cost millions upon millions of dollars and requires a complete overhaul).  Airlines don\u2019t want to do D-Checks on planes unless they\u2019re going to be keeping them for another 6-8 years (of course cycles come into play so if a plane typically does a lot more short hops than cross country flying, they\u2019ll hit more heavy maintenance. But the vast majority of them are being sent to BHM because they were nearing C-check which is still expensive (a little over a million $), but nothing like a D-check which can cost $6-8M - think stripping the entire plane down and putting it back together again.  A D-Check on a 737 700 is incredibly uncommon as for their size, they use a lot of gas so their CASM (Cost per Available Seat Mile) are much higher than a comparably sized aircraft like an A-220 (or the Max 7 if it ever gains certification).  So yeah, they\u2019re like 747-400s - they can be made to fly at a cost, but then the cost to operate is really high.  In fact, it\u2019s cheaper for SW to fly a Max 800 with 30-40 empty seats than a 737-700.  To prove my point on this, Avelo has purchased a few Southwest 737-700s and performed the C-Check maintenance, along with interior overhaul and livery paint.  Probably $5m out the door for a plane that looks from the outside like it\u2019s brand new.\n\nAs far as European slots, sure - Heathrow - they\u2019re not going there.

So as soon as my ticket was booked, I handled that via X. I know that if I'm on an AA flight, operated by another carriers, I'm going to have 2 different booking references and need to go to the individual airlines' sites in order to manage my booking for seat and meal selection, etc. All in all, unless the ticket was booked absolutely last minute, then there was time to deal with any questions, etc. well before check-in even if check-in (as is often required) needs to happen at the airport.

But some tarmac stops still can drag maddeningly on.\n\nDepending on how long you\u2019re stuck on the tarmac, airlines in the United States have certain obligations.\n\nPer\u00a0[Department of Transportation rules](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/tarmac-delays), at the two-hour mark, airlines must provide their passengers with food, water,\u00a0[\u201ccomfortable\u201d cabin temperatures,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/07/26/plane-cabin-extreme-heat-passengers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14)\u00a0access to functioning toilets and medical assistance, if needed. After that \u2014 before three hours on the tarmac for domestic flights, and before four for international flights \u2014 an aircraft must provide customers the option to deplane. The exception to this rule, Napoli said, is if a safety issue is preventing the plane from returning to the gate.\n\nThe same tarmac rules apply for arriving planes. If travelers are not provided with these essential provisions, Napoli recommends filing a complaint with the airline as soon as possible.\n\nRead more for free here: [https://wapo.st/3zVSGjI](https://wapo.st/3zVSGjI)", "username": "washingtonpost", "score": 0, "post_id": "1eb295o", "parent_id": "t3_1eb295o"}, {"id": "ler0qo8", "date": "2024-07-25 02:42:07", "content": "OP.

So I don't have any special inside info, but have been following all of this verrrrry closely since my kid is due to fly home in the middle of all of it all. \ud83d\ude43\n\nSo, on a good day,  once you check your bags, they're going to the destination airport on your original itinerary. There's no real stopping that. That's not a Delta thing, that's universal. They aren't going to go back and pull your bag off of the speeding conveyor system or dig through a cargo hold's worth of Tetris'ed luggage to get someone's bag off the plane. \n\nSo Scenario 1: it goes to the original destination. It'll wait in the Delta luggage claim office until you get there, and if you beat it, you can pick it up from the destination airport. \n\nOn a good day, sometimes if the airline is at fault, they'll send someone to deliver luggage to you. If you willingly (albeit under duress) cancelled, they probably won't, especially with the enormous volume of bags right now. \n\n\nNow.... Where things get dicey for you. Unless that first flight got cancelled by Delta, your bags have or will connect through ATL.\n\nScenario 2: If your original flight out of ABQ  arrived at ATL before your original connection, your bag *might* end up at the destination still. \n\nScenario 3: If that connection flight left first or is cancelled, your bag is very likely going to be in a biiiiiiig sea of bags at ATL also affected by all of this mess. The pictures of the ATL baggage situation are wild....I don't think I've ever quite seen anything like it. In that case, it's probably going to take some time to get your bag back. I'm not sure what scale of time. It would most likely get sent back to your initial airport. \n\nIn the meantime, track where your bag is in the Delta app, so you at least know the airport it's at currently.  To get it, You may need to fill out a form for lost luggage. They're usually really quick about connecting people to lost luggage (or luggage that's in the shuffle of things). But by the looks of some of the pics online of ATL, there are thousands of other people all trying to get reconnected with their luggage. \n\nThis is such a frustrating thing to go through, and the customer facing employees at Delta aren't spared from that frustration. I feel so bad for them. The crowdstrike thing was like the sneeze that kicked off an avalanche for Delta. Specifically Delta because it sounds like the execs really did a number stripping down IT infrastructure and personnel, outsourcing IT personnel, and a baffling lack of continuity plans. \n\nNearly every system is impacted somehow or another. There are numerous reports of flight crews, including pilots, who can't access scheduling info or support. Sets of planes in the fleet that are \"missing\" in their internal systems (all of the 717s were mentioned at one point, and ex lion air 737-9s...).\n\n Passengers are getting to gates about to board and they're short one crew member and end up having to delay or cancel, or have no crew.  The expected crew have no idea they're supposed to be scheduled there because they can't access scheduling and are on hold for 8-10+ hours (there was a post about that too). But they're busy working and are bottlenecked wherever they are.  Even if they do know, they may not be able to get there because everything else is bottlenecked. And then say a plane is cleared for taxi in a hub like ATL, the wait time to actually take off is gonna be nuts.  It's a damn mess. All of it. \n \n\nNone of this is the fault of the person at the airport check-in counter, or working the ramp, or working the luggage area, or the gate agents, or the airport level managers (\"red coats\") or the pilots or flight attendants or ground crew.  They all know their procedures and are following them. They're all working with a failed system, and inadequate procedures in place and are adapting as much as possible. \n\nNow, if you want to lodge a complaint (and do!), by all means write one directed toward the corporate execs who made the looong series of poor decisions that led to this. \n\nThe employees are doing everything they can and are worn and torn down. Some are being pulled back from their personal leave time. Salaried employees are jumping in and volunteering grueling amounts of time to help with bottlenecks and learning on the fly bc corporate didn't provide any training. \n\nI didn't intend to write a novel, there's just a lot to unpack.

The later you check in, the better chance you have at a random seat before row 11. Row 11 is where they start assigned the \u201cno chosen seat\u201d people. So if you check in say 2 hours before flight, and they started 22 hours ago with row 11 back, and then everyone checks in to fill all of those rows, you automatically get a seat closer to the front (if it\u2019s a full plane and the back rows are all now assigned automatically). It\u2019s never 1 or 2. Starts at 3. Also, they are cheaper to upgrade to right before takeoff because it\u2019s the last chance for the airline to make money on that seat as a paid upgrade. So, if you check in like 2 hours before you usually can pay like $15-$17 and get one of the front seats for super cheap (or even free if they auto assign you).

We had an agent several years ago exploit a loophole in our system to try to send fraudulent refund checks to his friends and family.

This is not in any way PCI compliant so I personally would not send my CC number through this channel. If this is a common practice on Frontier's part they should probably get a huge spanking from their merchant services provider.\n\nI direct a customer service unit with a contact center BPO and we would neverrrrre everrrrrrrr ask for a plain text CC. We use a secure payment portal software that pops up a separate window or sends a caller to an automated system to record and process a CC number, then sends a confirmation to our system when the CC goes through successfully, then routes the customer back to the agent to finalize the transaction. Our agents aren't even allowed to keep pens at their desks because if they do happen to hear or see a CC number they can't write it down without a pen.\n\nFor refunds, if the transaction is within, I think, 90 days there is absolutely no reason why they can't refund to the CC without the card number. If it's older than that our system defaults to a check refund.
