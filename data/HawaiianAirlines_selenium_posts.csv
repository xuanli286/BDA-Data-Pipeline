Walking to baggage claim, I get a notification that my item was left behind (AirTag inside) but I didn‚Äôt get the notification until crossing out of the secure area, so I couldn‚Äôt return to the gate.

It was 2230 so there were no Hawaiian agents in the ticketing hall, as expected, so I continued down to baggage claim and spoke with the Hawaiian agent there. 

The lovely agent was very kind, and within 30 seconds of me telling her what happened, she had someone on the radio and they confirmed they found my bag, and returned it to me a few minutes later.

I‚Äôm flying to Europe tomorrow, and getting separated from my passport could easily have been a nightmare, but the awesome crew at SFO saved my bacon, and I am very appreciative.

I‚Äôve left kudos through the official channels, but just wanted to give them a shoutout here and to reiterate that service is always better on Hawaiian.",ChequeOneTwoThree,0,32,HawaiianAirlines

Hi everyone. I need to know if there is anyone else out there who has experienced this.

Hawaiian Airlines attendants have been promoting an In-Flight Hawaiian Airlines Elite Mastercard Credit Card offer for years. They say the same speech on the plane every time. The offer is that you only have to spend $1 on the credit card in order to receive the 70,000 (or 60,000?) bonus points. Their standard offer is that you have to spend $2,000 in the first 90 days in order to receive those bonus points. But the flight attendants make it VERY CLEAR that the promotion is that you only have to spend $1 if you take the in flight offer.

I did that, spent over $1, and never received my bonus points. Here is the problem: When I called Barclays, the credit card company that backs the Hawaiian Airlines Mastercard, they say that the promotion they see attached to my credit card was an inflight offer, and that it is $2000 in the first 90 days in order to receive the bonus points. They told me their relationship with Hawaiian Airlines is black and white. They have no influence over what Hawaiian Airlines promotes, and cannot make any adjustments to bonus points. They are just the credit card company. So I went and called Hawaiian Airlines directly and spoke to a supervisor, who tried to send me back to Barclays, and who was of no help. She regurgitated scripted responses but eventually in conversation she admitted that she ""does not have access to the promotions"" and DID NOT KNOW about the in flight offer. She is a representative of Hawaiian Airlines, and did not know that employees of the airlines are promoting a special that they have been for years??? Make that make sense.

I am extremely frustrated. I want my bonus points. But that's now not even the main issue. The main issue for me is that the flight attendants are heavily pushing people to apply for a credit card with an offer that the company does not seem to know about. This seems incredibly fraudulent.

Has anyone else experienced this? I know there are those out there being scammed like I am. What should I do next to bring attention to this? I love flying with Hawaiian Airlines but this is messed up.",SwimmingCaramel4792,68,22,HawaiianAirlines

I had a flight from BOS to HNL back in January (direct), due to engine issues the flight ended up getting cancelled. Multiple people who were on my flight have had issues with HA.

Allianz reimbursed everything within two weeks with  proof of all the above, along with a document from HA proving the flight was indeed cancelled.

Hawaiian said I could change my flight but I will be out the $760. Please give advice, am I reading their email incorrectly? I feel it clearly states I can cancel my offer up to 28 hours prior to departure. The email doesn't say ""you might be able to"" or doesn't say ""you can cancel your offer as long as..."" Etc etc. The email doesnt state that the offer may be accepted prior to the 28 hour deadline either. The call center is based out in the Philippines and I feel there was a language barrier. I asked to speak to a supervisor or someone with English as a first language and they said it wasn't possible.

1bxqrnb,2024-04-07 08:25:18,Hawaiian makes me cry,"I've never had a travel experience that has left me in tears and not wanting to travel again. Today's HA 39 PDX &gt; OGG &gt; Kona was delayed due to ""pieces of the airplane you can see on the ground if you look out the window."" Tim, Ops manager told us, not to worry, it's just A/C maintenance and he'll go out and help and to come back at in 3 hrs. When we came back in 3 hrs, Tim gave an announcement that the maintenance person had broken a piece trying to get it out and the flight was being delayed until 11:15 pm (most likely and a full 13.5 hours after the original flight) and using the last flight in from Maui to turnaround to take us back - which would have all of us landing in the middle of the night and traveling for some folks, almost 24 hrs accounting for early airport arrivals. Only food vouchers were offered for $30. And a snack box in the morning.

When I went to ask Tim if there was a way to book on the next day's flight instead, which is what he was busy doing for the passenger in front of me, another agent asked if she could answer my question. 

When I asked about the new arrival and the likelihood that there wouldn't be flights in the middle of the night in Maui to take me on to Kona, she rudely said - DID YOU NOT HEAR THE ANNOUNCEMENT WE JUST MADE? You didn't hear it?

Surprised, I said yes, I heard about the delay, my concern is that aren't flights when we land. 

She said they can't control the flights and the connecting flights will be determined when we're in the air. She seemed incredibly frustrated (understandably, lots of people were upset and lots of chaos was happening) and even when I asked again, how will I get a new flight from Maui to Kona if there are no flights in the middle of the night. I don't want to be stranded in Maui overnight. 

She got visibly annoyed and said, YOU ARE NOT LISTENTING TO ME. We can't control when the flights are going to be scheduled until we're in the air. I said, I understand but then we will still have to be traveling for hours on end. I wanted to get a flight for the next day and get answers to what that would entail. My baseline expectation would have been for her try understand what my question/concern was and help solve it. Instead, she said, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT THIS EFFECTS. There are other people here trying to get to Kona. I said I understand that and must have looked shocked, and I was, at how she was speaking to me. Then, she looked at Tim and interrupted him while he was still helping the woman in front of me to say, Can you deal with her? She's not getting it. She's just not getting it. And walked away. 

To his immense credit, throughout the entire morning and situation, Tim was incredibly calm and collected. When he asked me how he could help, I told him I'd like to book the flight for the next day as I live locally and don't want to travel that many hours and miss another connecting flight. While helping me, he was interrupted several times by other agents who needed his help or input and with his phone ringing. I told him I would wait until he was able to take care of those things. As he was helping me, I heard the same gate agent talk to the person behind me - who had the same situation of going to Kona and having kids and not being ideal to have them all travel for that long and that late. She was incredibly empathetic, understanding, asked where he and his family were sitting, went to them and walked them to a different kiosk to help with booking another flight. Same situation, completely different response. At this point, I started crying. And I cried through the whole interaction with Tim. No one acknowledged that or asked or offered any kind of empathy. The gate agent made me feel less than human, like an idiot. I have deep empathy in these high stress situations, having worked in Customer Service for 15 years. This was not ok and it wasn't warranted.

While Tim was able to move me to tomorrow's flight, he didn't ask about seat assignments, or give any other information or set expectations - except, my bag will be on tomorrow's flight. I think. I took a taxi home and will take another taxi back tomorrow. Another expense I didn't expect to incur. Then,¬†when I got home, I called customer service to see if I could change my seat assignment as the one he assigned wasn't in the same class. I was on hold for over 30 minutes and total call time was an hour. At first, the agent said she could refund the seat upgrade I had on the original flight and then I'd just have to pay for the upgrade for the new flight. I selected a seat and then she said could no longer assign me any seats other than the one Tim assigned because seating had been locked down by the gate agents. I will have to go tomorrow to see if there is a way I can get my preferred seat. At least she was able to get me a refund for my original seat upgrade which is something that Tim never offered. So, I'll get on my flight tomorrow and hope it doesn't break down or get treated like less than and that my luggage will actually make it there.¬†

What makes me extra upset is that I had booked this trip on Alaska Airlines originally and changed it last minute because I wanted to treat myself to what has always been exceptional experiences with Hawaiian.

Finally, the fact that the flight wasn‚Äôt cancelled, likely because doing so would incur significant reimbursement costs, was a business decision that put the onus of the maintenance mistake onto many passengers. This trip will end up costing me more than $1000 more than anticipated because Hawaiian didn‚Äôt want to do the right thing by their customers. Those costs are missed accommodations, transportation, and food.

There were so many moments for this business to do the right thing, to solidify and strengthen customer loyalty, that just weren‚Äôt met. I get it ‚Äì things are hard all over, gas/oil prices, competition, inflation, etc.¬†But this ain't how you fix it. Please start with ensuring gate agents, Ops folks, and crew are paid fairly and aren't overworked, and please provide empathy training.

1cegubz,2024-04-27 23:15:14,"Well, that was fun","Yesterday morning, after much looking, I went to book our trip from AUS-HNL. From my previous searches, I knew they only flew this route on Mondays and Thursdays, and only returned on Wednesdays and Sundays; all other days in the search calendar are disabled. However, when I finally went to book, this had inverted, and now Sundays and Wednesdays were the only days enabled for the outbound, and vice versa for the return. That would be fine, but when you search on those enabled days, there are no flight results. I manually typed in the date for Monday and forced the search, and voila, there was the flight. I booked it, and called HA to upgrade with miles.

About 6 hours later, I logged into ""My Trips"" just to gawk at my reservation, I guess, and I noticed it was missing. No matter, let me look it up by the confirmation code. No such reservation. I texted HA and was informed that somehow, the previous agent neglected to ticket my upgrade, so the system auto-canceled the whole reservation, and now the flight was ""sold out."" Uh... it was only half full a few hours ago? Did all of the 49ers book the remaining seats? Worse yet, they couldn't find the 150,000 miles I had used for the upgrade. I was asked to call in and request a supervisor.

While I awaited a supervisor, I had a hunch, and went back on HA's booking search. This time, when I used the new enabled days, there was a flight result (at a different time, too). It became apparent that they must have been rolling out a schedule change yesterday, and somehow the web team made their change before the actual schedule/backend change was complete. I got my supervisor, who was equally as perplexed as the text agent, saying that the flight had been canceled. At this point, I revealed my hypothesis, she did some checking, and said I was right.

Supervisor was ultimately able to locate my money and my points, void the old reservation out, redeposit everything to my account, and stayed with me while I rebooked the new dates, then executed my miles upgrade. The bittersweet upside to this is that the new flights had cheaper, Saver upgrades available, so I ended up with miles leftover (I had transferred in exactly what I needed from AmEx). I was able to salvage these by getting a convertible for our 3 days on the Big Island.

Not exactly how I wanted to spend my Friday night, but seems to be fixed now - unless they make another change in the next few months (I hear the AUS-HNL route is volatile), and as frustrating as the issue was, all of the agents were unexpectedly kind, understanding, and helpful - a lost skill in today's customer service. The IT consultant in me wanted to ask for the CIO's number because it looks like this was all caused by a wildly uncoordinated change - even if I was *kinda* breaking stuff to make my reservation (but hey, my forcible search showed a flight that, at that time, existed).

Anyway, if I still have any of you after all of that, do I get a free checked bag if I upgraded with miles? My ticket says 0PC, so I don't know if the miles upgrade only gets me Fisher Price First Class and I still gotta pay for my bags.",Matchboxx,10,23,HawaiianAirlines

Unfortunately HA doesn‚Äôt have any direct/reasonable flights from Chicago, hence why we did LAX. The current issue I‚Äôm running into is the Chicago to LAX tickets.

Essentially the round trip connecting flight for Chicago / LAX costs nearly the same as a round trip ORD / LAS / KOA through Southwest.

If we keep the Hawaiian flights, our biggest issue is having a 5+ hour layover coming home when we land in LAX. I‚Äôm also worried if there‚Äôs any flight delays or cancellations since these flights are being coordinated separately. And again, while our HA flights were basically free, we are paying almost the same amount for the connecting flight as we would for Chicago -&gt; KOA through another airline.

We purchased basic cabin with HA so we wouldn‚Äôt get a refund but I think we can change the flights. However I‚Äôm not sure what we would change it to.

I‚Äôm just at a loss for what is worth doing. Keep the HA flights and coordinate the connecting flights separately‚Äîeven if cost/timing isn‚Äôt ideal? Or cancel HA entirely and book the flights through Southwest?

Booked this flight months ago and was upgraded to 1st class. Immediately got on the phone with HA ticketing and almost booked onto an American flight leaving on 4/10. Until the agent apparently pressed the wrong button and we were sent to their standard survey! Called back and nothing was logged in our reservation and now there were no flights available for 4/10. The agent found a 4/11 HA35 flight and we booked 2 extra comfort seats for an additional $200. Complaint was noted and we can call consumer affairs for a refund for having to pay this. So the worst part of this is our Airbnb will be empty tomorrow for around $500. We probably have to also pay for luggage which was originally free for our first class tickets. Would probably feel a little better if we were ever given a reason why the flight was cancelled other than the legal departments explanation of ""no plane"". We booked using Hawaiin Mastercard with travel delay insurance but it appears that only covers death or illness situations.

1dq4jiu,2024-06-28 06:51:44,FYI Hawaiian airlines doesn‚Äôt allow name transfers ,"
Update 
Supervisor was able to help me I just had to rebuy the ticket to prove I was really going to use it for someone else. After writing this post I have learned that airlines do not offer name transfer and to always buy refundable tickets. I am very grateful for the supervisor for helping me because I know she didn‚Äôt have to help me. Thank you to everyone commenting and explaining the rules of transferring names, refundable tickets and insurance. 




If you plan on flying with Hawaiian make sure you get insurance. My dad bought us tickets to Hawaii for next week as a gift I had plans on taking my 3yr old daughter she is level 3 autistic. At the time of on the book in January her behavior and meltdowns weren‚Äôt as bad recently things have been getting worse. We decided it would be better that she stayed with her dad and other grandparents. So we called Hawaiian to ask to cancel her ticket and transfer it to someone else so my dad didn‚Äôt lose out on his money. The agent yelled at me and told me it‚Äôs against their policy and there nothing they could do. I explained everything I was calm and asked to speak to a supervisor he continued to yell and say there was no supervisors and the answer was no. He said the only thing he can offer me was a credit that only my 3 yr old daughter could use within a yr again that wouldn‚Äôt work because she can‚Äôt fly and obviously can‚Äôt fly alone. I kept demanding to speak to a supervisor he finally agrees I guess one magically appeared. The supervisor was so nice and so understanding of the situation and understood that it wouldn‚Äôt be safe to fly with a child that can‚Äôt regulate her moods. She offered me to rebuy the ticket and she would refund my daughter ticket as long as I was really transferring it to someone else which I was and everything got solved. I wish the first agent just listened to what was going on and had empathy. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a refund at all. 

For future reference always get insurance and read the small print just in case you never know. ",Ginny_Mama,95,91,HawaiianAirlines
