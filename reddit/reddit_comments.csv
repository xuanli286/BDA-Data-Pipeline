Here are some things to consider about skiplagging:

Airlines don't like it

Airlines don't like skiplagging because it costs them money.¬†They can try to penalize passengers or challenge them in court.

Legal fees can be high

Court battles can be lengthy and expensive, and passengers may not be able to afford to challenge the airline.

Airlines can take other actions

Even if a passenger doesn't break the law, the airline can decide to stop serving them, wipe out their frequent flyer accounts, or ban them from flying.

244,lscvjzb,2024-10-17 21:04:02,"Agree with this comment 100%! 

When my toddler outgrew the cosco scenera we got the cosco finale. Lightweight and easier to travel with than the one we use at home. Also relatively cheap for a car seat, and turns out once we made the purchase we found plenty of times at home where an extra car seat came in handy. 

If you need a car seat at your destination, I would recommend bringing it on the plan for the kiddo to sit in. Renting car seats with rental car companies is a huge gamble, I‚Äôve hear stories of there only being infant seats available for a 4yo or missing buckles. You are also welcome to check the car seat either 1) with your checked luggage before security or 2) at the gate where you drop it off right before you step on the plane and pick it up in the same spot when you get off. There‚Äôs a small risk of it getting lost or damaged if you check it. But it does not count against your two free checked bags. 

If grandma is picking you up from the airport and already has a reliable car seat, you can forego brining a car seat altogether. In any other circumstance I personally bring the cosco finale (or scenera) on the plane with us and strap my kiddo into a window seat for the flight. 

Oh one last thing - if you choose not to go the cosco car seat route, you need to triple check the car seat you bring is approved for airplane use. Should be a sticker indicating the approval on the side of the car seat. The gate agent and flight attendant may ask to see it to verify.",dumb_username_69,2,1g5p4wf,t1_lsco9sw

There is no way to load a SWA GC to your account.

Many companies sell their own GCs via a 3rd party.  That 3rd party transaction will not bill as SWA and therefore not qualify for credit.  I have never bought a SWA GC for full price and never from SWA, so I don't know if this is the case.

There is always a risk of fraud with GCs.

You can only use a maximum of 3 payment methods to purchase a ticket on SWA.

SWA is an enormous company.  They don't care if you cancel.  I have cancelled thousands of SWA tickets.

If when you call in ask for the gov‚Äôt rate and ask for the YCA fare. Sometimes they know that, and others times they don‚Äôt. You could further explain that you need an Anytime fare ticket at the gov‚Äôt rate. 

Sometimes they give you the CA fare price (which is dirt cheap and has all the WGA exclusions and restrictions) and other times it‚Äôs ONLY YCA fares that are available and ONLY on direct flights.

I‚Äôll go even 1 step further as to say this: if the rate available to the public (non-gov‚Äôt system rate and not calling in to get the gov‚Äôt rate) is cheaper than the gov‚Äôt contracted rate, even by a little bit, why wouldn‚Äôt the gov‚Äôt approve that reimbursable charge?

The stock buyback is a corporation using its favorable financial status to use excess cash to repurchase shares, decreasing the number of shares outstanding and increasing the stock price. They bought back $451m in 2020, $1.05b in 2019, $2.0b in 2018, etc. (https://ycharts.com/companies/LUV/stock_buyback)

This is simply privatizing profits while socializing losses (or risks).

that wouldn't have happened. during the pandemic alitalia went bankrupt, was nationalized, and it got reorganized as ITA airlines. most of the employees stayed on. italy is a country that can't set its own monetary policy so they can't just bail out their state airline at will like america does:

>On 10 October 2020, the Italian government signed a decree to allow to reorganize the airline as ITA - Italia Trasporto Aereo S.p.A.[59] On 28 October 2020, it was reported that ITA would buy several assets from Alitalia - Societ√† Aerea Italiana S.p.A., including the brand and the flight codes of Alitalia and Alitalia CityLiner, the International Air Transport Association ticketing code (055), the MilleMiglia frequent-flyer program, and airport slots at London Heathrow (68 weekly slots in summer and 65 in winter).

So right now you would choose a cross country flight with a connection on Southwest over non-stop on United/Delta just to maybe avoid a middle seat?  Even with short notice, there are often window/aisle seats available on Delta/United.

Also, we have no idea yet how difficult it will be for AL/ALP to get window/aisle seats.  That will depend on what kind of premium SW charges for premium seats and how many non AL/ALP passengers are willing to pay for those premium seats.  Presumably, it will be very easy to log in to your account, check seat availability and move to an aisle/window when one opens up if only middles were available at time of booking.

Considering ALP gets free access to both extra legroom and up-front standard legroom at no extra cost at time of booking, even short notice ALP flyers should do just fine with seat selection.",Forkboy2,2,1g4jfe6,t1_ls4mdkk

Southwest has half of Concourse C and 19 gates (downsizing to 11).  Even prior to this announcement, they were flying 60% fewer flights out of Atlanta than AirTran did.  Now I see a ton of Frontier and Spirit planes at ATL on the D and E concourses.  They‚Äôre not having any issues competing with Delta.  Let me put it like this - if AirTran had 6 flights per day from Fort Lauderdale or Miami to ATL, Southwest came in and eventually got down to three flights per day, but those flights were packed full.  Then they moved the flight times to one leaving out of FLL at 6 AM, the second at 5 PM, and the third at 10 PM - well guess what?  Nobody wants to fly at those times of the day regardless if the return flight is at a decent time, so they‚Äôll book Delta or Spirit or anything that flies out at a time they need.  So now the flights are desolate (I was on a 6 AM ghost flight out of Fort Myers to ATL the other day with 8 other passengers).  

Screw Boeing - that isn‚Äôt the issue.  Southwest‚Äôs aircraft utilization is already among the lowest in the industry - they‚Äôre not flying their existing planes enough and now say they‚Äôre going to start selling off aircraft to other airlines (and not talking about the 737-700 dinosaurs but 737-800 and 737-8 Max), potentially selling Boeing delivery slots instead of taking deliveries, and talking about selling jets to leasing companies and then leasing them back to make cash in the short-term while spending more in the long-term.

Their lame excuses suck.  If they didn‚Äôt want the East Coast and Florida, they shouldn‚Äôt have bought AirTran, simple as that.  They can‚Äôt compete because they‚Äôre freaking idiots.  Elliott are bigger idiots who will only make things worse, but at this time, I‚Äôm only focused on the stock price so I can get out at a decent level to break even.

The second thing you need to do is set aside your pet flight fee. It's $125 per animal/per direction. You pay that when you arrive at the airport.¬†


The third thing you need to do is make an appointment with your vet to talk about how to safely travel with your cat. You need to make sure this young animal is as vaccinated as possible, has healthy enough lungs to withstand the pressure changes, and can take medication to manage their anxiety.¬†


If all of those things are done and in order, you can go onward with reading the Southwest pet guidelines IN DEPTH and purchasing a carrier that fits the plane. You can then Google and learn about how other people handle TSA with cats, how to pack your pet for a long day like this, etc.¬†

If you are flying right before or after Thanksgiving, give yourself 3 hours. Security is where you'll be waiting.¬†


The airport lists security times on their website, and you can check them on the sly: https://www.atl.com/times/¬† I've found them to be accurate in the sense of ""Main says 20 minutes, so main will suck. North says 5 minutes which means north will be faster than main but probably not 5 minutes."" Keep in mind that North has the first class line.¬†


If you are flying out before 9a, the airport will be running dogs.

The dogs take a bit longer, and they take up space in the middle of the queue where 100 people would otherwise be. The lines look artificially long.¬†


If your wife is anxious about security, encourage her to pack very few things that need to leave her bag. Check bags! Direct flight means checked bags are going to arrive with y'all. Don't pack liquids and gels and tons of food and things that will require her to unpack her bag at security. I fly A LOT (6-10 times a month at this point). My default carry-on packing situation is a leather tote I love and my purse. My headphones come off my neck, and my bags go in bins. Nothing needs to come out or in or up or down. It makes going through TSA so much nicer for me. Even before I had Pre-Check, nothing was coming out because I wanted the fastest, easiest TSA experience.¬†


I am a ""dad"" flyer. I want to be at my gate 90-120 minutes before my flight. My wife is a ""Chad"" flyer. (She named herself that.) She wants to walk into the airport 45 minutes before her flight and walk up to her gate as the agent is calling for pre-boards. Obviously we compromise. But when we're flying together during the holiday season, we get there early. We do it on my timing preferences because I am much calmer so her day is better.

777,lrzochk,2024-10-15 12:14:05,"When I flew with toddlers, (memorably a 3 year old and 5 year old,) and two adults, it worked fine to have one little person and one adult together. We would try to be in rows adjacent, or in front and behind each other, but not necessarily all one row. Switch up the adult/kid combo on each flight. 

I didn't expect a small child to be self- entertained the whole flight. The grownup needs to know when to offer  a new treat or activity.

One thing that worked great - make every little thing last longer by wrapping it up. 

I took snippets of tissue paper and ribbon and rolled little toys and occasional treats inside. Lots of paper means it takes a bit of time to unroll and enjoy. I had a little gift bag special for each child, with several little wrapped things inside. It doesn't matter if it's a fruit rollup or a happy meal toy; it becomes a big deal when it has to be unwrapped.

Make some kind of game about when a toy or snack can be selected and unwrapped - for example, let the child pick cards from a shuffled deck. When the child pulls the joker (or a pair, or any face card - whatever you say), they can reach in the bag and unwrap one item. This keeps kids really occupied and makes them engaged with the activity. 

You can also play a version of ""I spy"" with whatever kids' movie being watched - next time you see someone wearing a hat, or anything with a tail,  or any character eating or drinking, or a flower, the person who sees it gets a point. Three points = reach in bag and get to unwrap snack or toy.
The ""I spy"" categories can be written out and folded into little squares of paper, again in a baggie. The child gets to reach in, pull one out and unfold, there's the word HAT and picture of a hat. All this takes time, and that's a good thing!",NotMyCircuits,6,1g3ysbs,t3_1g3ysbs

Even better if you can swing a big gift card to bank your travel funds - check Costco on when they'll do their next $430 for $500 sale.

1248,lrxjd32,2024-10-15 04:17:55,"Depends.  The CP offer in February is easier to get since you only have to complete the minimum spending.  But it only lasts the year.

If you get the card now, complete spending in January, and then keep spending to get the extra 40k points or whatever, you'll get CP for 2025 AND 2026.  And probably more SUB points.  

It depends on how much you fly and spend. I had plenty of point bonuses this year and plenty of flights, so I got to CP by September WITHOUT a SUB.  

So I would opt for getting the card now .  But just make sure you don't hit the required spending until January",Ok-Contribution7317,2,1g267ln,t1_lrrsv3d

American wouldn't help her, told her to talk to Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus said they can't do anything, had to get to the airport.

If this had all come out earlier she'd be on a Delta or United flight and not have these issues.

The bigger issue is that there is/was no communication, and neither of the customer service reps could help, instead referring us to the other's help desk. Once she checked in at the airport, they tell her she's on standby. She finally gets in contact with AA customer service and all they can say is various versions of ""that's strange"" and ""we've never seen that happen before."" They even tried to tell her she wasn't on standby when she held a boarding pass that clearly said ""standby"" on it.

I have flown numerous airlines to Asia, Middle East, and Europe, none of them on AA or one of their partners. I have had multiple issues on AA here in the US. So, moving forward, I'll coordinate my travel taking extra care to avoid AA or any of their partners

It did eventually work out, however, the stress and angst is not worth repeating. If AA doesn't wake up and change their process, they will end another failed entity.

I'm just saying that I do fly AA a lot and Aer Lingus even this week and with experience comes additional insight regarding how to handle issues when they pop up. On this last trip I mentioned, I knew I was on Aer Lingus out of GLA and that my OneWorld Emerald status via my Exec Plat as AA was not going to net me free seat selection. So as soon as my ticket was booked, I handled that via X. I know that if I'm on an AA flight, operated by another carriers, I'm going to have 2 different booking references and need to go to the individual airlines' sites in order to manage my booking for seat and meal selection, etc. All in all, unless the ticket was booked absolutely last minute, then there was time to deal with any questions, etc. well before check-in even if check-in (as is often required) needs to happen at the airport. As I said, the only thing I can't speak to is the stand-by issue as that is certainly strange. I'm not a representative of AA nor a shill for them, but offering a counterpoint that I've never had an issue traveling on an AA booked flight which included segments that were British Air flights operated by Aer Lingus. The only thing I don't particularly like is that Aer Lingus isn't a full OneWorld partner so my status benefits don't carry over. Glad it worked out.

Book one pair, then the 2nd pair.  There is nothing to ‚Äòtransfer‚Äô just book the tickets from the certificate holders account and just don‚Äôt list the certificate holder as a passenger on that ticket. Then to avoid unaccompanied minor fees on the last 3, you‚Äôll need to call in to have an agent help with those.  They will ‚Äòlink‚Äô them, but linking is just a free text note that the computer system does not use.  If an agent is doing manual adjustments (due to irops) they may or may not notice it or abide by it.  So know there is a potential to be separated in a worst case scenario (hope for the best have a plan if the worst occurs).

One of the challenges you‚Äôll have is finding a flight with 4 companion cert seats available. That is to say, once you book the first cert, they may not be any cert inventory left.  You won‚Äôt know until after you book. Again an agent would be helpful for this.  If you book one cert but there is no more inventory you at least solve the 3rd reservation with unaccompanied minor issue. 

I‚Äôd plan for at least an hour with an agent (after hold time) to find flights and then complete all three bookings.  If schedule is your driver then you could just find an acceptable flight and book the first pair and if there is more inventory book the 2nd pair, then call in for the 3rd.",delta8765,2,1fyecp0,t1_lqxrfw8

1998,lfutjhp,2024-08-01 02:49:30,"My guess is there is an issue with weather and temperature involving taking off with a heavy weight and fuel consumption. There could also be a large amount of unexpected headwinds on the route or weather they have to fly around that the aircraft won‚Äôt have fuel for.

That is an exceptionally long route and SJU is an intermediate point they can stop at along the way.

But due to customs and regulatory reasons they can‚Äôt take the passengers on a whim to SJU instead. But, they likely could in an emergency if they were already en route.

Since they couldn‚Äôt make it, they opted to cancel that one flight and have the plane repositioned to not have to cancel the next outbound flight out of Atlanta back to cape town.

It could also be due to an air craft issue where they thought they could fly to SJU to make it to ATL and they could properly work on it in ATL.

It looks like the plane will be in ATL for 12 hours before flying back to cape town currently.

This is the oddity of ultra-long haul travel. You often to fly to places where you don‚Äôt have assets in place to be back up. Honestly, this falls under normal operation as something that sometimes just happens.

Oddly enough sometimes it‚Äôs better to cancel one flight than have the next 6 heavily delayed and keep the plane on schedule.

They don‚Äôt need to stop in SJU for flight attendants vs. getting them in Atlanta. Even if they picked up personnel in SJU, they have many flights a day on the SJU-ATL route. They would send them to ATL on those existing flights.

Having enough functional flight attendants is an issue. It‚Äôs possible one of the ones in Cape Town on a previous flight got sick causing a delay and needing a replacement. But I don‚Äôt think that wouldn‚Äôt explain why they go to SJU.",cwdawg15,5,1egulgw,t1_lfuvfe7

It‚Äôs literally about the wing and the software that runs the wing.  I didn‚Äôt believe it either but that‚Äôs the truth. 

The third version of the wing is the closest to what was promised in the brochure when Airbus sold the 350 to DAL 

The software is the best it can be for that particular plane. The software patches are unique to each wing. 

Add a little bit of those and the fact the weather in atl required enough gas to fly to an alternate and then hang out for another 45 minutes. You now need another hour and 15 min worth of gas and gas for the go around at the destination,  so a stop is required because the brochure didn‚Äôt match what delta received.

For long haul routes like this, aircraft can be re-released  from a point along the route. So when you leave jnb legally you can kinda wait and see ,inflight, if you need that extra hour and 15 of gas or not. Sometimes the forecast is so bad that there is no wait and see, your stopping.

But while delays often are miserable, they can be even more so when you‚Äôre waiting on the tarmac, as some of the outage-affected passengers said they were. It doesn‚Äôt help that, in a¬†[summer](https://abcnews.go.com/US/extreme-heat-end-current-forecasts/story?id=111843703)¬†of extreme and¬†[dangerous heat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/heat-index-temperatures-global-cities/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4), planes¬†[can‚Äôt cool cabins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/07/26/plane-cabin-extreme-heat-passengers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)¬†on the ground as well as they can in the sky.

If your flight is stuck on the tarmac past a certain point, airlines may owe you. But there‚Äôs a catch.

The protections for U.S. airline passengers are ‚Äúrudimentary‚Äù compared to in Europe, said Eric Napoli, the chief legal officer at claims management company AirHelp. ‚ÄúThe best you‚Äôre going to get is what airlines want to offer you in the terms and conditions you have for that airline.‚Äù

You‚Äôll have to advocate for yourself.

***Your basic rights while on the tarmac***

Tarmac delays have shortened significantly since the Transportation Department established customer-protection rules for delays, said William McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project. But some tarmac stops still can drag maddeningly on.

Depending on how long you‚Äôre stuck on the tarmac, airlines in the United States have certain obligations.

Per¬†[Department of Transportation rules](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/tarmac-delays), at the two-hour mark, airlines must provide their passengers with food, water,¬†[‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù cabin temperatures,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/07/26/plane-cabin-extreme-heat-passengers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14)¬†access to functioning toilets and medical assistance, if needed. After that ‚Äî before three hours on the tarmac for domestic flights, and before four for international flights ‚Äî an aircraft must provide customers the option to deplane. The exception to this rule, Napoli said, is if a safety issue is preventing the plane from returning to the gate.

The same tarmac rules apply for arriving planes. If travelers are not provided with these essential provisions, Napoli recommends filing a complaint with the airline as soon as possible.

2298,lecwdgc,2024-07-22 17:51:05,"Hey there. So I don't have any special inside info, but have been following all of this verrrrry closely since my kid is due to fly home in the middle of all of it all. üôÉ

So, on a good day,  once you check your bags, they're going to the destination airport on your original itinerary. There's no real stopping that. That's not a Delta thing, that's universal. They aren't going to go back and pull your bag off of the speeding conveyor system or dig through a cargo hold's worth of Tetris'ed luggage to get someone's bag off the plane. 

So Scenario 1: it goes to the original destination. It'll wait in the Delta luggage claim office until you get there, and if you beat it, you can pick it up from the destination airport. 

On a good day, sometimes if the airline is at fault, they'll send someone to deliver luggage to you. If you willingly (albeit under duress) cancelled, they probably won't, especially with the enormous volume of bags right now. 


Now.... Where things get dicey for you. Unless that first flight got cancelled by Delta, your bags have or will connect through ATL.

Scenario 2: If your original flight out of ABQ  arrived at ATL before your original connection, your bag *might* end up at the destination still. 

Scenario 3: If that connection flight left first or is cancelled, your bag is very likely going to be in a biiiiiiig sea of bags at ATL also affected by all of this mess. The pictures of the ATL baggage situation are wild....I don't think I've ever quite seen anything like it. In that case, it's probably going to take some time to get your bag back. I'm not sure what scale of time. It would most likely get sent back to your initial airport. 

In the meantime, track where your bag is in the Delta app, so you at least know the airport it's at currently.  To get it, You may need to fill out a form for lost luggage. They're usually really quick about connecting people to lost luggage (or luggage that's in the shuffle of things). But by the looks of some of the pics online of ATL, there are thousands of other people all trying to get reconnected with their luggage. 

This is such a frustrating thing to go through, and the customer facing employees at Delta aren't spared from that frustration. I feel so bad for them. The crowdstrike thing was like the sneeze that kicked off an avalanche for Delta. Specifically Delta because it sounds like the execs really did a number stripping down IT infrastructure and personnel, outsourcing IT personnel, and a baffling lack of continuity plans. 

Nearly every system is impacted somehow or another. There are numerous reports of flight crews, including pilots, who can't access scheduling info or support. Sets of planes in the fleet that are ""missing"" in their internal systems (all of the 717s were mentioned at one point, and ex lion air 737-9s...).

 Passengers are getting to gates about to board and they're short one crew member and end up having to delay or cancel, or have no crew.  The expected crew have no idea they're supposed to be scheduled there because they can't access scheduling and are on hold for 8-10+ hours (there was a post about that too). But they're busy working and are bottlenecked wherever they are.  Even if they do know, they may not be able to get there because everything else is bottlenecked. And then say a plane is cleared for taxi in a hub like ATL, the wait time to actually take off is gonna be nuts.  It's a damn mess. All of it. 
 

None of this is the fault of the person at the airport check-in counter, or working the ramp, or working the luggage area, or the gate agents, or the airport level managers (""red coats"") or the pilots or flight attendants or ground crew.  They all know their procedures and are following them. They're all working with a failed system, and inadequate procedures in place and are adapting as much as possible. 

Now, if you want to lodge a complaint (and do!), by all means write one directed toward the corporate execs who made the looong series of poor decisions that led to this. 

The employees are doing everything they can and are worn and torn down. Some are being pulled back from their personal leave time. Salaried employees are jumping in and volunteering grueling amounts of time to help with bottlenecks and learning on the fly bc corporate didn't provide any training.

If there aren't direct flights to your originating airport, you could tinker around and see if it'd be more beneficial to stick with one airline, or to get into the US on one and then connect on another. (Book enough time for customs, baggage, and security at the connection.)

JetBlue, for instance, has a handful of options from Santo Domingo to JFK. That'd at least get you back in the US, then go from there either continue on JetBlue, or switch to American, Southwest... 

Idk about compensation beyond refunded fare. A lot of people are in your situation, and this was way outside of Delta's control, affecting a lot of industries. Hospitals in my city had to cancel all non-emergency surgeries, some government operations are gummed up, people have lost work, businesses have lost money. Employees of affected companies are scrambling to get things back to normal. It sucks for everyone and I hope that crowdstrike makes it right.

For now though, I hope you're able to find an alternative solution to get back sooner.

Edit to add: Here's a post with info directly from a tweet by Sec. Buttigieg. Tldr, some airlines are only ""offering"" e-credits, but you are entitled to a full and prompt actual refund, not just ecredits.

Additionally, when the delay or cancelation is within Delta's control (i.e. maintenance or staffing) they will typically cover the hotel if you have an overnight delay. Delta may cover hotels for CrowdStrike related cancellations - but it is an evolving situation so monitor Delta's official announcements. For those outside their control (weather or ATC) they typically will only provide the rebooking (or a refund if you prefer to cancel and no longer fly).

From your post it's unclear what the cause of the delay was, but that will control what you are entitled to.

Additionally, if you have travel insurance (either purchased for the trip, or from a premium credit card), you can submit a claim to them for the delay and any documented expenses.

However, in either case you won't receive any financial compensation for any intangible items, like a missed day of work. You may receive some SkyMiles as a customer service gesture if you submit a complaint.

My own two cents, having gone through a MUCH smaller scale (but multi-day) situation domestically: If I was in your position right now, I'd choose to get as far as I could today even though it's uncertain whether you'll get to JFK on the originally intended flight. 

Get to Athens. Even with an 8 hour delay, you still  have at least a 6 hour window to make your next flight - more if the flight into JFK ends up delayed. 

 Go into it being mentally prepared that you may or may not make the connection flight. Start looking around for places to stay in Athens if you end up needing it, that will take the stress off later. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst.

I chose to hide my information from the public by the FAA and so the only way employee address's could've been found is through internal methods.

Second, mechanics have seen what the unions will do first-hand, as well as how other mechanics are treated by these same unions. Teamsters by far and wide, was the worst choice that we could've been given. Their representation is akin to high school debate clubs, and their overall bargaining power is not near the level we expect to compare ourselves to with the likes of ALPA. The preferred organization would be another ALPA drive like there was in the early 2000's, and I'm confident that if this were to happen, mechanics would've signed >50%. Teamsters would not be able to hold a candle to what could be done with ALPA, and is apparent with how UAL feels and the ALPA drives they have held. Signing with Teamsters would've given us no major industry increases over that of our rivals, a certain reduction of Delta mechanic AMT positions, and heavy stagnation. It would be AMFA 2.0.

You get into periods like now for pilots where demand was so high, we got a really good contract. I think of it like the stock market.

I would rather have ""teeth"" against my company and a contract gives you that. Is it always perfect? No. My company constantly tries to roll us over on our contract but we can fight back. Without a union or a contract, the company can just as easily takes things away as given. It's delayed gratification. If this industry is temporary for you, makes sense why you wouldn't want the temporary paycut. But if it's a career, it's worth it. Especially when young",BeechGuy1900,4,1e5seao,t1_ldr7qld

I've often favored unions over coorporations because, historically, their work has impacted every field, and they've gotten the workforce benefits and perks that every employee in every industry enjoys today. However, I've also been exposed to companies that genuinely take care of their employees without the benefit of a union.

2441,ldrndkj,2024-07-18 21:20:26,"I think the big airlines take care of their employees when times are good. However, Airlines have extremely tight margains so if business isn't good, they will look at anything to cut costs from. Labor and fuel are two costs that airlines can really eat into if needed because theyre the biggest behind aircraft costs which are fixed. I would agree there are some companies that do that, but I don't think that applies to any of the airlines. They will chew you up if they need to, especially if there is a weak labor market with lost of applicants

Edit to add: I also wouldn't compare it to pilots. Compare to other similar group. Below wing to below wing, in service to in service etc. Again, Delta FA are doing good because the company can afford to throw money at them to not unionize. That lead won't last forever. If you want a pilot comparison look at major air line pilots to regional pilots. Major airlines have stronger unions so we get better working conditions",BeechGuy1900,2,1e5seao,t1_ldrlbxu

Delta One will likeley become First Class.  This makes sense:  One ==> First Class, not business class.  The ""Delta One = Business class"" never made sense to me, especially when domestic ""First Class"" was a less than premium product.  Crazyiness.

Premium Select and components of Comfort+ will evolve into the ""New"" business class.  How this gets structured will be interesting.

Also a way to siphon out skymiles from circulation assuming one can pay cash or redeem miles to *checks notes* select a fucking seat in business class.

I just went to my Global Certificate that expires in 2025 and on Delta operated flights, the fare class open must be RV/OK/OV class. But, for AF, KLM, KA if they have Z fare open, then you can upgrade with a GUC. Here are the details.

1. **Applicable Fare Classes:**¬†Certificate may be used to upgrade on Delta Air Lines or a valid carrier (as specified above) on published retail fares booked in P, A, G, S, W, Y, B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T, X or V class and upgrade into RV/OK/OV class on Delta operated flights, and may also be used to upgrade on Award Travel tickets and Miles + Cash tickets on Delta-operated flights, Pay with Miles tickets and Companion Certificates. Certificate may not be used to upgrade other published fares including those booked in Basic Economy. For travel on KLM-operated, Delta-marketed flights this certificate may be used to upgrade on published fares booked in Y, B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T, X or V class and all fare classes upgrade into Z class. For travel on KLM-operated flights marketed by KLM, fares booked in Y, B, M, K, H, L, Q, T, N, R, or V class are eligible to upgrade into Z class. For travel on KLM-operated flights marketed by AF, this certificate may be used to upgrade on published fares booked in Y, B, M, K, H, L, Q, T, N, R, or V class into Z class. For travel on Air France-operated flights marketed by Air France and booked in Y, B, M, K, H, L, Q, T, N, R, or V class, customers can upgrade into A class (Premium Economy), or they can upgrade from W, S, or A class into Z class (Business Class). For Air France-operated flights marketed by KLM, customers with a published fare booked in Y, B, M, K, H, L, Q, T, N, R, or V class can upgrade into A class (Premium Economy), or they can upgrade from W, S, or A class into Z class (Business Class). For Air France-operated flights marketed by Delta, customers with a published fare booked in Y, B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T, X or V class can upgrade into A class (Premium Economy)In addition, customers traveling on an Air France-operated, Delta-marketed flight and booked in P, A, or G class can upgrade to Z class (Business Class). For travel on Aeromexico operated, Delta marketed flights this certificate may be used to upgrade on Delta\`s published fares booked in W, Y, B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T, X or V class and all fare classes upgrade into Aeromexico\`s O class. Valid on Delta-marketed, Virgin Atlantic-operated flights for use globally on published fares booked in W, S, Y, B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T, X or V class to Virgin Atlantic's P class (Premium Economy), or from fares booked in P, A, G class to Virgin Atlantic's G class (Upper Class).Valid on Delta-marketed, Korean Air-operated flights for use globally on Delta's published fares booked in J class to Korean Air's A class, Y or B class to Korean Air's Z class, or booked in M class to Korean Air's O class.

I kept monitoring the website and calling every week. Last week when I called the agent had multiple seats available not showing on the website that were suddenly available to book. So now my family is seated together. 

So my advice if you‚Äôre not willing to pay the money is to keep calling. And go for the angle not of all of you together but making sure every kid is next to at least one adult. That gives them more flexibility.

Yes... while I hope it was cathartic, as you suggest, to write out your experience on reddit, I would not expect sympathy from this subreddit by suggesting that someone's dog should have died so you could go on vacation.

After reading your post, the unfortunate truth is that you signed a contract that you did not understand. You purchased an itinerary that had no room for any disruption, but neglected to understand the airline's responsibilities to you in the event of a disruption. 

> On top of that, Hawaiian Airlines announced that they scrambled a flight out at 1am the next day, well after we'd cancelled our travel package and while in the middle of the call with customer service.

Yes, because there was zero room in your itinerary for error, you abandoned your trip and began requesting compensation immediately upon the diversion. A 1AM flight from Oakland would arrive on Oahu at 3AM, if you had not cancelled your trip, you would have gotten there a day late. 

> I just can't get over just how much hassle and frustration and uncertainty we had to go through.

You booked a 3-day trip with a toddler on an airline that operates one flight a day. No form of travel is 100% reliable, even if the equipment is fine, a medical diversion would have resulted in exactly the same outcome on your end, with even less compensation due to you. Not purchasing travel insurance, on a three day trip to hawaii, was a mistake.

It's unfortunate that you were unable to visit Hawaii, but the majority of the hassle, frustration and uncertainty that you experienced was avoidable by better understanding the contracts you had agreed to, and by purchasing disruption insurance on an itinerary you chose that had zero room for disruption.",ChequeOneTwoThree,22,1g2md8h,t3_1g2md8h

Currently, the two free bags only applies to the cardholder, not the student or your aunt that you bought the tickets for or your spouse/travel partner.

For example:  say you want four bags to be checked in free if you and your spouse/travel partner have separate (not joint) HA credit cards?  Book separately using your own HA credit card for your ticket and then your spouse/travel partner purchase their ticket on the website with their HA credit card. 

Having the card alone does NOT give you the benefit.  It's called a loyalty card. Hope this helps anyone out there using the HA credit card.

They made a drastic change to the dates on a ticket I booked next March. The new change doesn't work with my vacation schedule, and apparently, there is an Alaska / Hawaiian flight combo instead of a complete Hawaiian flight where I am flying from. I called them to tell them I would like to keep my original flight time even though it's now operated on Alaska / Hawaiian. They kept offering me earlier dates than my vacation time, which they mentioned were flights operated only by Hawaiian. I mentioned I could not fly earlier than the date I booked.

I then mentioned I would be open to flying on a partner airline since it is mentioned on their website they can do that. They wouldn't budge, and they wouldn't book me on the Alaska / Hawaiian flight combo either. I kept mentioning the flight change was their doing, and they would need to reschedule me on a flight that works for me.

Both of the CS agents at the end said, ""You can just cancel your flight."" üòí

**Additional Fees for Oversize Baggage**. When a bag exceeds an Outside Linear Dimension of 62 inches (157 cm), it will incur an additional oversize charge as follows, which is in addition to the Standard Bag fee and any overweight fees.

   1. Baggage with an Outside Linear Dimension greater than 62 inches (157 cm), but not exceeding an Outside Linear Dimension of 80 inches (203 cm):
      1. Between points within the State of Hawaii, the additional oversize baggage fee is $35.00 per oversized piece.
      2. For Domestic travel that is not wholly within the State of Hawaii, the additional oversize baggage fee is $200.00 for each oversized piece.
   2. Baggage in excess of the stated dimensions above will not be accepted, except as expressly provided elsewhere in this¬†Rule 18.

Each time, I've brought back 4-5 pieces of luggage, a mix of regular suitcases, large duffel bags, u-haul cardboard boxes, and plastic storage containers. As long as they're under 50 lbs and meet the dimension criteria (under 62 inches L+W+H), you pay regular bag fees. Cardboard is kind of flimsy, so I shipped clothing in those boxes. The plastic (Costco/Walmart/Home Depot) storage containers are better for more fragile items. The more square the box, the more volume you get for the max allowed dimension. Uhaul's large cardboard moving box at 24x18x18 is closest to this max. 
This past year, I was able to bring back 5 pieces free each trip because of my miles status and Hawaiian credit card. I think fees are normally $30 - 1st bag, $40 - 2nd ($15/20 if you're a Hawaiian miles member) inter-island, $40/45 to the mainland.",Funny-Car-9945,2,1fr0wvq,t3_1fr0wvq

1) are you okay with HA‚Äôs routes? If you want to travel to places that HA doesn‚Äôt have routes for. The card may not be best for you)

2) there is an annual fee ($99). Look at your budget. Do some napkin math to estimate how much money you‚Äôd spend a month/year on the card, then use that to estimate the miles you‚Äôd earn. From there you can calculate if the time it takes to earn the miles you‚Äôd want for the routes you want and see if the annual fee is worth it. 

If it would take you more than a year, or the number is below 2,000 miles a month, id consider options like using the BOH HA debit card instead. $3 a month, but can you could still earn miles (it‚Äôs capped at 1,000 miles a month) but again all of this depends on your purchase power and the HA credit card weighed against the other CCs in your wallet.",izzymatic,1,1fqslcb,t3_1fqslcb

Alaska and Hawaiian are merging mileage programs next year. If you are able, just start getting credit cards to load up on Alaska and Hawaiian miles, and they‚Äôll combine next year.

A different arbitrage you can do, Alaska basic fares earn 30% miles towards status, while Hawaiian earn 100%. So it‚Äôs possible to earn Hawaiian status buying very cheap fares. I estimate $1300 for 4x RT tickets HNL-SFO, and that gets you status.

Because Hawaiian is a destination airline, much of the program is aimed at people who come to hawaii on vacation every year. If you live here, and can fly Hawaiian a few times between the mainland each year, you can get status, where you would need to fly 3x more, or purchase more expensive tickets, with Alaska.

3182,lq1kcu5,2024-10-03 05:36:45,"I am a long time alaska card holder and my family have multiple business and personal cards that allows me 4 companion pass per year.¬†

We always use the companion pass and generally happy about it.¬†

What i learnt is the best usage is to fly to hawaii, mexico, bermuda, basically long haul flights at peak season. We just bought SEA-CUN for new year 2025 trip and that flight would have cost us $800 per person. After using companion cert, the second person only pays $267. So after factoring the annual credit card fees, we are still up $500+

There are some years where we can‚Äôt maximize the companion cert value. So we typically use it for a short haul flights such as SEA-LAX or SEA-LAS. Normally we barely breakeven after factoring the annual card fees, but we just shrug it off. It just means we havent maximized the companion pass value.¬†

I am particularly excited with the hawaiian addition especially as it opens more pacific routes. I doubt alaska would allow use of the companion pass for those routes (errm: Delta), but if they do, i‚Äôd probably open more alaska credit cards üòâ",err-reddit,1,1fkj20g,t3_1fkj20g

I think if they got their way, they would throw a bunch of 175s there and open an HNL domicile at Horizon, maybe with Pualani on the tails for local feel. The operating cost of regional crews and planes is just so much lower that it would kind of trump anything else.

From my understanding the E195-E2 and the E175s have commonality

Seattle and Portland would be a stretch (particularly Portland) given the 787-9 has more seats to fill than the A330-200 (the 787-9 seats 290 in mixed class configuration while the A330-200 seats 250). If they went with the -8 model that would be closer to the A330 in capacity (242 passengers in mixed class).  

Also Hawaiian has a standing order for just 9 787s which again would likely be  prioritised for their Pacific international routes and routes to the east coast/Dallas.  They currently have 24 A330-200s and a single A330-300 which means if all the Airbus aircraft are disposed of, 737NG and Max aircraft would likely take their place on west coast to Hawai'i routes unless Alaska Air Corp places an additional order for 787-9s (or -8s on the west coast coast routes).

The cost of a single (new) 787-9 is 249.5$ million so to replace the remaining 15 A330-200s would come to around 3.7 billion USD mot taking into account any fleet discount. Going with pre owned 787s would come to a total of around 2.5 billion USD   If they  went with 787-8s would still be expensive as each goes for 239 million USD saving only about 115 million on the total order compared the -9 series for the same number of aircraft.

As a condition of the merger, Alaska Air Group is also assuming 900 million USD in debt owed by Hawaiian, so not sure if they are that financially healthy to absorb such a massive expense even spread out over say a 10 - 20 year period.

I'm not 100% sure if the 195 E2 is a common type rating with the 170/190 type. Even if it is, you run into the scope conundrum. Alaska Airlines per s√© doesn't have a 175 program; Horizon does:

 If you send Horizon to Hawaii operate the 195 E2, then you open the scope can of worms because it's a regional in Hawaii (not allowed by current HA pilot/FA contracts) and also greater than 76 seats (not allowed by Alaska's pilot contract)

If you make the 195 E2 a Hawaiian or mainline Alaska fleet, then there really isn't any cost implementation savings because neither pilot nor FA group is trained on the airframe.

Uplift is just giving you a loan‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no reason they would need a partnership in order to loan you money to sell you a ticket.

Collaboration doesn‚Äôt mean anything legally binding. They can argue that since Uplift has a link to the Hawaiian airlines website, they are in collaboration.

The chance is as close to zero as you can get, without being zero. 

The Department of Transportation told airlines they should do everything possible to seat children next to adults, and most airlines are treating this like a rule. For example, United now allows adults to pick seats next to children, even on their Basic Economy fares which normally do not allow seat selection at all.

3568,ls6rfyi,2024-10-16 19:55:54,"This can happen with any airline. 

I fly Frontier when I can go personal item only, don‚Äôt need a connection and don‚Äôt have any set place to be in case of delays since most of the flights I would take with them (or any other budget airline) only have one flight a day and only fly that route a few days a week.  Checked bags or carry on fees eat into the cost savings. 

Most of my flights are tied to other expenses like hotels or events I want to attend so typically the only time I fly budget airlines is to visit family when there isn‚Äôt a set time I need to be there or my job (or manager) will have issues if I‚Äôm delayed on my return.  

I stopped flying Frontier when I was working because any delays could cause a problem if I couldn‚Äôt get back to work as planned (personal item only meant my work laptop wouldn‚Äôt fit and I couldn‚Äôt nod my job with a tablet that I usually would bring). Now that I retired I recently flew them since I could deal with not going if the outbound flight was cancelled and I would extend my stay if the return one couldn‚Äôt be booked for a few days if if was delayed or cancelled.  

When flying any budget airline or even legacy carrier with limited flight schedules, you need to book with eyes open and think about what your plan B is if your trip is disrupted.

There‚Äôs a protocol that should have been followed and unfortunately the gate agent didn‚Äôt seem to follow the proper protocol nor maintain correspondence with you guys or the specific frontier department which we send emails to back and forward. In a scenario like this, whenever I work an oversold flight I ensure to tell the passenger to stay in the gate area while I wrap up the flight and close the loading bridge door. I then make sure that the amount of passengers checked in matched the passengers who were boarded and then count one very last time before closing the aircraft door, to make sure there really aren‚Äôt any seats left‚Ä¶ because if there was‚Ä¶. I would send any passengers waiting to fill in the open seats, board them, and then close out the flight on the computer and shut the aircraft door. 

Once that is complete, then the gate agent has to verify your personal details including email, phone, address to ensure that the voucher will be properly received. Without this information properly accounted for in the system, the vouchers will not be sent. The agent should also document the reservation. 

Sometimes there is a high volume of emails received. So getting compensated will usually take an hour if this is the case. But the agent shouldn‚Äôt wait to re accommodate you on the next available flight. They can do that and then take care of sending the proper email.

Meaning someone who is willing to pay could take it and whoever didn‚Äôt pay and got it by status is bumped. There‚Äôs a trick to this frequent fliers are aware of. The later you check in, the better chance you have at a random seat before row 11. Row 11 is where they start assigned the ‚Äúno chosen seat‚Äù people. So if you check in say 2 hours before flight, and they started 22 hours ago with row 11 back, and then everyone checks in to fill all of those rows, you automatically get a seat closer to the front (if it‚Äôs a full plane and the back rows are all now assigned automatically). It‚Äôs never 1 or 2. Starts at 3. Also, they are cheaper to upgrade to right before takeoff because it‚Äôs the last chance for the airline to make money on that seat as a paid upgrade. So, if you check in like 2 hours before you usually can pay like $15-$17 and get one of the front seats for super cheap (or even free if they auto assign you). But if you opt to pay, it will move someone that was free to a different less valuable seat.

Frontier has decided that the flight attendants will do a quick trash pickup between deplaning & boarding.  Unpaid, of course.  This is extremely rushed because the gate agents are anxious to board.  Gate agents are supposed to come onboard & vacuum, they do not.

They are incentivized not to help you, find ways to charge you more.  They send smaller planes to save money and screw over customers.  Just spend 10 minutes reading other people‚Äôs experiences. I fly all airlines from private jets to southwest, American, Delta to jet blue, Allegiant etc.  

My Uber driver at Denver airport today asked ‚Äúhow was your flight?‚Äù  I told him I got in late because I had to switch from frontier to Alaskan.

The real issue is that you fell for the scare tactic. Frontier will deny your claims and refer back to their ironclad agreement that you signed before flying. In situations like this, you should always call for a supervisor. You will sadly do more kicking and screaming than receiving compensation in this scenario.

Next time.... demand a supervisor and record the incident and details. Do not fall for this extortion tactic and be willing to ""miss the flight."" The choice for the airline to not allow you to board will be reported as is required. This is where you are to remain calm and stick to the facts with a supervisor. 9/10 times they will side with their employees, and you will be forced to find another way home. 

This is the part where you spend even more money on a same day flight from another airline. Just when you thought you were totally f**ked.... file a claim with DOT with all the details and the video.

The carry on bag fee is designed to limit the number of carry on to a reasonable limit by reducing the luggage people haul and by getting those bags checked. Plus it provides revenue for an airline that is flying you for practically free or below cost.",ValuableShoulder5059,1,1fxc46m,t1_lqngwd1

A backpack is generally good, but if you have anything bigger than that you should check the website and actually measure. Ere on the side of caution, because they have a box up front to check and if it doesn't fit in that, they'll charge you $80 (domestic). They won't let you board unless you pay. I have seen people skip the box because they felt confident, and they ended up missing their flights when they didn't have enough to pay.

And that is really the hidden fees. They aren't hidden, because you already know you don't want to check a bag, but if you are even a quarter of an inch off, they charge more than standard airlines do for the 'carry on included' price. Stuff like that is the main thing. You have to pay for pretty much anything other than water to drink and any decent food. But if you don't care about that and do care about legroom? You're in luck bc the upgraded seats do get you that.

There's also a 90% chance you'll be rerouted through Denver - no matter where in the US you are flying - and your flight hours will drastically change as a result.

I‚Äôd never fly Frontier (or Allegiant) if I had to be dependent on either as my only source to get to a timed event.

Also we have booked a fully refundable flight on SW that left after the Frontier flight time to have a strong plan b in place.  This past May had my flight to Tampa get straight up cancelled with no explanation.

Another thing that drives me nuts about Frontier is when they cancel or delay they will only email and not text you.  This has happened to everyone in my family and some coworkers so keep checking your email.

Some gates are religious about checking your personal bag size - Cincinnati almost always, Tampa almost never.

The whole scam was dumb as hell for a lot of reasons, chief among them was all his transactions were associated to his user account. So when we noticed these odd refunds we were immediately able to identify that it was just one agent doing them and who he was. I would try to get in contact with Frontier corporate to report this behavior because it stinks to high heaven of CC theft to me

.  This is not in any way PCI compliant so I personally would not send my CC number through this channel. If this is a common practice on Frontier's part they should probably get a huge spanking from their merchant services provider.

I direct a customer service unit with a contact center BPO and we would neverrrrre everrrrrrrr ask for a plain text CC. We use a secure payment portal software that pops up a separate window or sends a caller to an automated system to record and process a CC number, then sends a confirmation to our system when the CC goes through successfully, then routes the customer back to the agent to finalize the transaction. Our agents aren't even allowed to keep pens at their desks because if they do happen to hear or see a CC number they can't write it down without a pen.

For refunds, if the transaction is within, I think, 90 days there is absolutely no reason why they can't refund to the CC without the card number. If it's older than that our system defaults to a check refund.
