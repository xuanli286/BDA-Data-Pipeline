What has been your experience in terms of wait time to receive the card bonus?\\n   * If I complete spend by end of next billing cycle (11/20) and the bonus takes 8 weeks to post to my account (so, in 2025), does that mean that the miles would then count for the 2025 calendar year, or would they somehow \\'postdate\\' to this year because they were earned then?\\n   * Or, should I slow my roll on the spend and close out the full 3 months if points actually take 8 weeks to arrive and count toward the year that they appear?\\n\\nEither way, I\\'m fine with it, CP still seems like a great bonus so 1 year/2 years, it\\'s pretty cool either way.

True enough, I started to seek customer service assistance through chat.  Nothing.  They cannot answer the most straightforward questions and cannot help one bit.  I had issues even timing flights and was confused between AM and PM.  I already gave out all the flight details. Still, they were confused.  I gave up and decided to call.  Lo and behold 52 minutes wait time.  \\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s not the icing on top, though. After a gruelling six or so hours, I then had to download all my receipts because, of course, I had swallowed all the fare differences amounting to over 2K USD, even if the flights I took were already flexible dates but with fare difference charges. Fair enough. But to top it all off, I cannot download my itinerary even if it\\'s showing me on my app the changes made.  \\n\\n  \\nMuch to my dismay, i chatted with an associate again.

Because of course, somebody had to do it, so I had to be transferred again.  After reviewing my case again for another 20 or so minutes.  I waited and finally got a response back from the agent saying, sorry, \"I can\\'t waive any charges for you because we can see it processed; however, the ticket wasn\\'t issued, meaning it will only be on hold until such time, and then it will drop.  If you want to secure your flights, I must reprocess and recharge you.  I guess the frustrating part is that there is no effort at all to make things right.  Do this or lose your flights.  I told them I booked my family on a separate booking, so I had no choice.   The response to me was almost insulting, just saying, well, can you give me the confirmation code of your family?  It\\'s just.... frustrating.

At the very least, we\\'d be back in San Diego and probably have to go home.\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes into the flight back, the flight crew announced that we were rerouted to Oakland International airport instead by some managing staff. That\\'s when my wife and I started to get worried. We were hopeful that the airline would figure things out, but it looked less and less likely that we\\'d make it to Hawaii that same day. Plus, we\\'d now be stuck in Oakland with our baby and not knowing what the airline planned.\\n\\nOur fears were confirmed about 40 minutes after we had landed and all the passengers had been kept on the airplane (but allowed to stand and stretch): the crew had to be relieved due to reaching the limits of their work time and there was no other flights and crews available to fly us out from Oakland. The manager on duty figured that the soonest we could get on another flight out would be the next day at 8 am. There would be accommodations provided, but everyone would have to line up to get them (while the airplanes luggage was being unloaded).\\n\\nTo make matters worse, we heard from several of the Hawaiian Airlines staff (including an announcement from the manager) that the mechanical failure was due to a heating element malfunctioning in the cargo area of the plane and that an animal in that area had to be checked on. Ultimately, we found out that animal was a dog. The whole flight of 400+ people was diverted and cancelled because of one (1) pet dog.\\n\\nBased on the information we had at the time on the plane, my wife and I decided to cancel our trip and try to recoup our money. That process included: contacting Costco Travel and cancelling our travel package, calling Hawaiian Airlines to get a refund, and figuring how we\\'d get home from Oakland.\\n\\nCostco Travel was, surprisingly, the easiest part of the process to cancel our trip. We explained our situation and they offered to refund us, understandably, with a loss of $300 for one day of accomodations. We were advised to contact our credit card to see if travel insurance could cover the remaining losses.\\n\\nAs we waited in line to get a hotel room, my wife called the Hawaiian Airlines customer service to request for a refund. The customer service staff initially offered a \"refund\" but wasn\\'t willing to clearly state for how much, instead telling my wife she\\'d be notified after a decision was made by phone or email.\\n\\nAfter the roundabout explanation and lack of assurances, the staff person asked if my wife accepted the terms. This upset my wife and she refused to accept their offer. Pressing for clarity, the staff person finally relented and explained that only half of our ticket costs would be refunded because we had already utilized half the cost of the round-trip tickets by flying with Hawaiian Airlines.\\n\\nThe terms offered were unacceptable to my wife, and she asked for a manager. (I am very appreciative of her calm under stressful circumstances, because I would have been intolerable.) Eventually, she spoke to the manager, explained our situation about being stranded in a random city with a baby, and the manager agreed to a full refund.\\n\\nAs for getting home, the Hawaiian Airlines customer service manager said they could not provide for us flights home, due to something related to the Alaska Airlines merger. They suggested we ask the ticketing desk manager for a voucher for car rental expenses, which we learned later that they couldn\\'t provide. On top of that, Hawaiian Airlines announced that they scrambled a flight out at 1am the next day, well after we\\'d cancelled our travel package and while in the middle of the call with customer service.\\n\\nAbout a day and a half later, a Thrifty rental car parked in our driveway, and out $500+, we\\'re home safely, thank goodness. But there\\'s still things that need to resolve, calls to be made, and receipts to submit; I just can\\'t get over just how much hassle and frustration and uncertainty we had to go through.\\n\\nTldr: Flight from SAN-HNL was diverted and cancelled due to mechanical failure to a random airport, therefore Hawaii trip cancelled, but Hawaiian Airlines resisted refunding full costs and did not provide a way home.', 'username': 'empty83', 'commentCount': 9, 'score': 0, 'subreddit': 'HawaiianAirlines'}, {'id': '1g2ig1d', 'date': '2024-10-13 13:10:32', 'title': 'Can you fly HA and get American Airlines miles, yet?', 'content': 'Now that merger is complete?

We’ve had flights canceled on layovers, no option for hotel - and then the refund was mailed to us three months later under my husbands name (even though I did all the booking). We’ve had whole days cut out of our vacations due to frontier just canceling our flights as we’ve shown up at the airport. \\nThis trip to Orlando has caused so many tears and I don’t know what to do anymore. \\nOriginally we were leaving the 11th- due to Milton our first round of flights got cancelled. That’s completely fine and made sense. We rescheduled for the next day. Then the next night we get the second alert that the lines were cancelled. We figured it was because the hurricane still, and felt frustrated but what can you do but work with the cards your given. Rebooked again. We get to the airport, and get on the plane and right as we are starting to leave… the plane never takes off. We sit, and are told that when they removed the loading dock somehow someone scraped the door, so they have to send maintenance down, but are assured from the pilot it’s an easy fix and just hang tight. An hour goes by, and everyone is just sitting on the plane waiting. The pilot again starts to say on the intercom they are just waiting for maintenance, but ASSURES us to not reschedule, because the “Have the staff and the man power” to make it to Orlando - and we will be leaving, so just hold tight. Next hour goes by, and the pilot says the plane was ready an hour and a half ago, but hasn’t been given the approval from HQ to leave. \\nAnother hour, the air got turned off, and the pilot offered everyone to get off the plane and walk around and he’d call us back when we’re leaving. That again there is no reason we wouldn’t leave tonight.\\nWe get off the plane, and walk around a bit. \\nCome back and another passenger told us while we were gone they made an announcement that the boarding would be soon. We hear nothing for another thirty minutes, and then everyone’s app all has changed the flight to the next morning at 10am. At this point we started to think we should just take the refund and book in full for another provider, but eventually don’t because of how much it was going to cost to buy another full round of tickets in 10 hours. \\nThe lady at the front said she had no clue why our apps say 10 am, because she was sure we would get on the plane that night. More time goes by, and the pilot lets us know that we won’t be leaving, and that we’ve all been rebooked for 10am. \\nWe leave the airport to get some sleep, and not only does the app not have any boarding time for our now 10 am flight… but even on the website it’s acting like we’ve already left (only\\nShowing our previous flight status). Since leaving we have had 3 additional delays - now pushing us to getting to Orlando at 2pm?

I’ve heard of people flying on just their Costco card but I was wondering if frontier checks your id before you board.

What next?', 'content': 'Hello all, I have been a frontier client for a long time, and today I had the worst experience in LGA airport. \\n\\nI have a personal laptop bag which is little bigger than most common bag but is with in the dimension of what frontier recommends, i.e., 14”x18”x8”. We were returning from New York (LGA) to Dallas (DFW) after a wonderful vacation with family (me, wife, daughters- 1.5yo, 4yo, 9yo, brother-in-law, his spouse, and in laws). We had a flight at 10:50pm, and definitely the gate agent noticed my bag; it’s not my first time. The agent asked me to check the size in the bin they had. I had travelled so many times in frontier and I was 100% sure it would fit. I tried and it didn’t fit just by even less than an half inch, it was a surprise to me; in my more than 100 flights and numerous bin check, I never had this issue. I have DEN deals and always fly via Frontier DFW-DEN (convenient and cheap) for my work. I was not sure what went wrong because I had less stuff than what I used to have.\\n\\nThe agent asked me to pay $99 for the bag since it no longer qualifies for personal bag. Then I noticed the bin they asked me to test was of Air Canada. I requested the agent that the bin is different that is why my bag didn’t go through. The agent was adamant and said there is nothing wrong with the bin (basically said the size is same) and asked me to pay $99. I was trying to defend my best but the agent didn’t budge. And there was another agent who played scare tactics and closed the door and went inside saying that we can no longer onboard. Now the panic started specially with my wife, she nearly broke down to tears and asked me to pay the money and leave the matter. I looked back and the panic was visible in all the family members. All the happy face turned pale. The agent gave me last chance to pay and board. Because the situation changed drastically I paid the $99 fee and we boarded the plane. I felt so bad and disappointed.\\n\\nNow comes the interesting part. Because the bag did’t fit, it was a mystery to me and I need to figure out why. It’s 3:30 am and instead of sleeping I am posting this, it is the proof how bad it hit me, whole flight i was thinking what happened there with the bag. Now I come and check the details, the Air Canada personal bag size is: 13”x17”x6”. That was sufficient enough size difference for my bag.\\n\\nNow I think there must be lots of victim of this scam Frontier is running. Fortunately my brother in law recorded enough proof of it in today’s event.\\n\\nWhat shall I do? Can I sue them; there must be lots of victim. They made me feel embarrassed and my wife panicked and cried; I felt so bad. It left a bitter taste for all of us after such a wonderful vacation. What do you guys suggest?\\n\\nSorry for the long post and thank you for reading.\\n\\nUPDATE (10/11/2024): After few multiple tries, they refunded $99. Phew!\\n\\nLesson learned: Please check the bin if it is has correct dimensions and get the proof if not.', 'username': '062bel313', 'commentCount': 81, 'score': 60, 'subreddit': 'frontierairlines'}, {'id': '1fx7z27', 'date': '2024-10-06 11:53:19', 'title': 'Frontier Airlines jet appears to catch fire while landing at Las Vegas airport, FAA investigating ', 'content': '', 'username': 'idkwhatimbrewin', 'commentCount': 13, 'score': 6, 'subreddit': 'frontierairlines'}, {'id': '1fx59as', 'date': '2024-10-06 09:14:57', 'title': 'First time on Frontier', 'content': 'Update: I cancelled my Frontier tickets and purchased with another airline.
